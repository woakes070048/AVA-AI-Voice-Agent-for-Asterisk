# Roadmap

## Vision

Asterisk AI Voice Agent (AAVA) aims to be the definitive open-source AI voice agent platform for Asterisk/FreePBX. We're building toward a world where any organization can deploy intelligent, natural voice agents on their existing phone infrastructure — with full control over privacy, cost, and provider choice.

### v6.5.0 — Local LLM Tool-Gated Response, Deepgram Flux, Gemini 3.1 (Shipped May 2026)

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Local LLM tool_context / tool_result protocol (#368)** | New v2 WebSocket message types so the local LLM waits for tool execution and resumes with the result injected into context. Cross-call ACL leakage guarded; both `tool_context` and system-prompt sync fail-closed. | ✅ Shipped |
| **Deepgram Flux v2 + nova-3 default** | `flux-general-en` / `flux-general-multi` correctly emit `version: "v2"` plus `eot_threshold` / `eager_eot_threshold` / `keyterms`. Pydantic enforces ranges. Admin UI surfaces a "Flux Turn-Detection Tuning" panel when a `flux-*` model is selected. Default listen model flipped to `nova-3` to align YAML with pre-v6.5.0 hardcoded runtime behavior. | ✅ Shipped |
| **Gemini 3.1 Flash Live verified compatible (#350, #356)** | Multi-part `serverContent` envelopes handled correctly by the existing parser; pinned by 9 unit tests. No engine changes required. | ✅ Shipped |
| **#351 Google Live barge-in** | Resolved as a documentation issue — production answer is `use_vertex_ai: true`. Architectural silence-gating refactor deferred to v6.6 (the experiment in `1763a441` was reverted in `cead273a` because the AudioSocket forwarding path needs a broader audio-path overhaul). | ✅ Documented |
| **#370 HTTP-tool-test `.env`-first guard** | Admin UI Environment-page edits to `AAVA_HTTP_TOOL_TEST_*` take effect without an `ai_engine` restart. | ✅ Shipped |

### v6.5.2 — xAI Grok provider, multi-instance full-agent providers, Admin UI polish (Shipped May 2026)

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **xAI Grok Voice Agent realtime provider (PR #394)** | Fifth full-agent realtime provider, structurally parallel to OpenAI Realtime and Google Live. μ-law @ 8 kHz both directions (xAI accepts `audio/pcmu` natively, no resampling), five named voices + custom voice ID, custom function-tools identical to OpenAI Realtime, YAML escape hatch for xAI-native tools (`web_search`, `x_search`, `file_search`, `mcp`). 30-min hard session cap per xAI's docs; structured warning at 28 min. Multi-instance from day one. Setup: [docs/Provider-Grok-Setup.md](Provider-Grok-Setup.md). | ✅ Shipped |
| **Multi-instance full-agent providers** | Multiple instances of the same full-agent provider type with isolated credentials (e.g. `acme_google_live` + `globex_google_live`). Provider instance keys are immutable call-routing identities; YAML `type` selects the kind. Per-instance credentials at `/app/project/secrets/providers/<provider_key>/`. Routing via `AI_PROVIDER`, `contexts.<name>.provider`, or DID-based dispatch. Setup: [docs/Multi-Instance-Full-Agent-Providers.md](Multi-Instance-Full-Agent-Providers.md). | ✅ Shipped |
| **Uniform per-instance credentials UX (PR #395)** | Shared `ProviderCredentialsCard` paste-style uploader wired into Grok, OpenAI Realtime, Deepgram, Google Live, and ElevenLabs Agent forms. EnvPage adds a "Per-Instance Provider Credentials" status section so operators can audit credentials without SSH. | ✅ Shipped |
| **Dashboard System Topology overhaul** | Tri-state per-component health (`null` / `true` / `false`) with 2-strike debounce so transient probe blips don't flip dots red. Backend probe timeouts bumped (ai_engine 1.5 s → 5 s; local_ai_server 2.5 s → 5 s). Layout rebuilt as explicit CSS grid with responsive provider grid, Models 3-col grid, and Asterisk + AI Engine cards stretched to match Providers height. Provider cards grouped by type. | ✅ Shipped |
| **HelpTooltip backfill (~260 tooltips)** | Inline help across provider forms, Setup Wizard, LLM/MCP/Profiles/Models pages. New `HelpTooltip` is viewport-aware: measures the trigger via `getBoundingClientRect` and flips placement to keep the popover visible inside scrolled modals. | ✅ Shipped |
| **`.ulaw` call recording playback** | Call Details modal plays compact `.ulaw` recordings via server-side `audioop.ulaw2lin` WAV wrapping. `.WAV` uppercase, compressed WAV, and `.gsm` recordings transcode via `sox` with `AAVA_RECORDING_TRANSCODE_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 120 s). | ✅ Shipped |

### v6.5.1 — CPU-demo profile + local provider hardening (Shipped May 2026)

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **CPU-demo profile end-to-end (PR #386)** | Faster-Whisper `tiny.en` + Piper + Qwen 0.5B wired through the Admin UI. New Device (`cpu`/`cuda`/`auto`) and Compute (`int8`/`float16`/`float32`) selectors with client-side gating that disables `float16` on CPU. New env vars `FASTER_WHISPER_DEVICE`, `FASTER_WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` persisted by the admin layer. | ✅ Shipped |
| **Runtime toggles without model reload** | New WS protocol field `runtime_config` for `enable_filler_audio` and `llm_streaming_tts_overlap`. Filler-audio enable pre-synthesizes phrases via the active TTS; disable clears the cache. Control plane skips no-op values; admin layer accepts `no_change` so a toggle flip with the value already at the requested state no longer triggers a container recreate. | ✅ Shipped |
| **Local provider audio hot-path hardening** | `send_audio()` no longer awaits `_reconnect()` per audio frame on disconnect (was blocking the producer for ~157s of backoff); drops the chunk and kicks `_start_background_reconnect()` instead, gated on prior-connection state. `asyncio.Lock` around `_reconnect()` for single-flight against `_send_loop`'s direct on-`ConnectionClosed` path. STT fragment suppression in full/llm modes narrowed to filler only so common confirmations like `"ok"`, names, numbers reach the LLM. | ✅ Shipped |
| **Faster-Whisper verify-path tolerance** | Admin verify path no longer rolls back working CPU/int8 fallback configurations as "verification failed" when `local_ai_server` resets device/compute on CUDA model init failure. Frontend CUDA gate also reads pending dropdown selection so picking CUDA on a CPU-only host is caught client-side. | ✅ Shipped |

### v6.6.0 — Deferred from v6.5 + Local AI Performance & Polish

| Feature | Description | Key Files | Effort |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **#351 silence-gating refactor (vad_mode-aware)** | The reverted experiment surfaced AudioSocket-path coupling that needs a broader audio-path overhaul + integration tests before silence-gating can honor `vad_mode`. | `src/providers/google_live.py`, AudioSocket forwarding path | High |
| **Local LLM Token Streaming (WebSocket)** | Server emits `llm_token` messages for pipeline `local_llm` adapter. Currently `_handle_llm_request()` in `local_ai_server/server.py` ignores `stream: true` and returns one `llm_response`. Wiring `process_llm_chat_streaming()` into the WS handler + setting `supports_streaming = True` on `LocalLLMAdapter` would give pipeline-mode users the same sentence-by-sentence overlap that full-mode already has. | `local_ai_server/server.py:5498` (WS handler), `src/pipelines/local.py:979` (adapter) | Medium (3-4h) |
| **Concurrent LLM+TTS Producer/Consumer** | In `_process_full_pipeline_streaming()` (`server.py:5067`), `await self.process_tts()` blocks the token loop ~200-800ms per sentence. Refactor into two `asyncio.create_task` — producer consumes tokens and pushes sentences to a queue, consumer synthesizes and emits. Needs backpressure and `_llm_lock` coordination. Marginal gain on CPU but significant with faster LLMs (GPU/remote). | `local_ai_server/server.py:5067-5187` | Medium (3-4h) |
| **Speculative LLM on Stable Partials** | Start LLM inference speculatively when STT partial transcript is stable >300ms with 5+ words. If final matches → use cached result (saves 300-1500ms). If not → discard and run fresh. Config-stubbed (`speculative_llm_enabled` etc. in `local_ai_server/config.py:154-157`). Requires `_llm_lock` coordination and session state for speculative results. Only benefits streaming STT backends (Vosk, Sherpa, Kroko) — not Whisper. | `local_ai_server/config.py:154`, `local_ai_server/server.py` (new), `local_ai_server/session.py` (new fields) | High (6-8h) |
| **Comfort Noise Injection** | Replace digital silence with low-level telephony comfort noise (~-40dB) during processing gaps (between STT final and first TTS audio). Pre-generate 1 second of µ-law noise at startup, inject into `StreamingPlaybackManager` when buffer is empty. Config-stubbed (`comfort_noise_enabled` in `local_ai_server/config.py:166`). Cosmetic improvement — filler audio already addresses the biggest UX gap. | `src/core/streaming_playback_manager.py`, `local_ai_server/config.py:166` | Low (2h) |
| **Local-LLM `tool_result` edge-case test suite** | Multiple tool results in flight for one call, reconnect during pending tool result, interaction with `farewell_mode=asterisk`. Protocol surface is now documented; tests are the next-cycle add. | `tests/test_local_ai_server_protocol_schema.py` (extend) | Medium |
