## [6.5.2] - 2026-05-24

### Breaking Changes

- **Full-agent provider aliases removed (branch `codex/multi-instance-full-agent-providers`, PR #394 + multi-instance work)**: `AI_PROVIDER` and `contexts.*.provider` no longer accept short aliases. Replace `openai` with `openai_realtime`, `google` with `google_live`, and `deepgram_agent` with `deepgram`. Configs that still use aliases now fail validation instead of silently selecting an ambiguous provider when multiple provider instances exist. Single-instance setups using the legacy `openai_realtime:` / `google_live:` / `deepgram:` / `elevenlabs:` / `grok:` block names (where the YAML key equals the kind) continue to work unchanged.

### Added

- **xAI Grok Voice Agent realtime provider, multi-instance from day one (branch `codex/multi-instance-full-agent-providers`, PR #394)**: New full-agent realtime provider for xAI's [Voice Agent API](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/audio/voice-agent) at `wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime?model=grok-voice-latest`. Structurally parallel to `OpenAIRealtimeProvider` and `GoogleLiveProvider` (Option C — standalone provider, not an OpenAI dialect — so xAI session-shape drift, xAI-native tools like `web_search` / `x_search` / `file_search` / `mcp`, and future xAI API changes can land in one isolated file without risk to OpenAI Realtime). Registered as a fifth entry in `FULL_AGENT_KINDS` so operators can configure multiple Grok instances (`acme_grok`, `globex_grok`) with per-instance credentials at `/app/project/secrets/providers/<key>/api-key`, routed via `AI_PROVIDER` channel var or `contexts.<name>.provider`. **Audio path:** μ-law @ 8 kHz both directions by default (xAI accepts `audio/pcmu` natively; matches Asterisk telephony format), with a `linear16` fallback for `slin16` AudioSocket setups. **Voice:** five named voices (`eve`, `ara`, `rex`, `sal`, `leo`) plus custom voice ID free-text for cloned voices. **Tools:** custom function-tool schema identical to OpenAI Realtime; xAI-native tools accepted via YAML `extra_tools` escape hatch (not in admin UI v1). **30-minute session cap:** logs a structured warning at the threshold set by `session_warn_after_seconds` (default 1680s / 28 min) so operators can correlate any user-visible call drops with this documented xAI limit. **Barge-in:** mirrors OpenAI Realtime exactly — drops unsent provider burst on `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`, drains the buffered tail. **Session.updated ACK:** xAI does not consistently send one; the provider waits ~2s and proceeds either way. **Setup guide:** [docs/Provider-Grok-Setup.md](docs/Provider-Grok-Setup.md). Single-tenant deployments work via legacy form (`grok:` block where the key equals the kind, env var `XAI_API_KEY`).
- **Multi-instance full-agent providers (branch `codex/multi-instance-full-agent-providers`)**: Admin UI and runtime now support multiple instances of the same full-agent provider type so operators can route separate customers to separate credentials, for example `acme_google_live` and `globex_google_live` both using `type: google_live`. Provider instance keys are immutable call-routing identities; YAML `type` selects the implementation kind. Provider-scoped credentials live under `/app/project/secrets/providers/<provider_key>/` and support `api-key`, ElevenLabs `agent-id`, and Google Vertex `vertex-json`; the new per-provider Vertex upload path does not mutate `.env`. The legacy global `/api/config/vertex-ai/credentials` endpoint is retained for compatibility and still updates `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` in `.env`. The engine provider-load loop iterates instance keys and dispatches by `kind`; lifecycle paths (`start_session`, `send_audio`, `stop_session`) are provider-agnostic and required no changes. See [docs/Multi-Instance-Full-Agent-Providers.md](docs/Multi-Instance-Full-Agent-Providers.md) for routing examples (direct provider pinning, context-based, DID-based dispatch).
- **Uniform per-instance credentials UX across full-agent provider forms (branch `codex/multi-instance-full-agent-providers`, PR #395)**: New shared `ProviderCredentialsCard` React component wired into every full-agent provider form (Grok, OpenAI Realtime, Deepgram, Google Live, ElevenLabs Agent) so the Add/Edit Provider modal exposes the same paste-style credentials uploader regardless of provider type. Writes per-instance secret files under `/app/project/secrets/providers/<provider_key>/{api-key,agent-id,vertex-json}` and updates the form's `api_key_file` / `agent_id_file` / `credentials_path` field to the resulting path, so saving the YAML and re-loading the form preserves the credential reference. **Delete is now sticky:** the previous form-save round-trip would resurrect a freshly-deleted `api_key_file` because the form's local state still held the old value; fixed by an `applyCredentialPatch` pass-through that lets `null` deletions clear the field through `updateForm` (Codex P1 on PR #395). EnvPage adds a new "Per-Instance Provider Credentials" section that surfaces each configured provider's credential file existence so operators can audit credentials without SSHing into the box. Inline `api_key` and `agent_id` values are still read for legacy configs, but the Admin UI migrates raw inline secrets to provider-scoped files on save.
- **Dashboard System Topology overhaul (branch `codex/multi-instance-full-agent-providers`)**: The Admin UI dashboard System Topology card is rebuilt around per-component health with debounced indicators so transient probe blips don't flip dots red. ARI / ai_engine / local_ai_server now use a tri-state (`null` = "Checking…", `true` = green, `false` = red) gated through a 2-strike debounce (`debouncedTri` / `debouncedBool`) so a single bad poll doesn't show red on a healthy system — every component holds at "Checking…" through engine warmup, then transitions to its true state once stable. Per-provider readiness uses the same 2-strike pattern via a `useRef<Map>` streak tracker, so providers also start at "Checking…" instead of flashing red on first paint. Backend probe timeouts bumped (`ai_engine` `/health` connect 1.5s → 5s; `local_ai_server` WebSocket `open_timeout` 2.5s → 5s) to stop legitimate localhost probes timing out under load. Layout rebuilt as an explicit CSS grid (`grid-cols-[160px_48px_160px_48px_minmax(420px,1fr)]`) with summary strip at top, responsive provider grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3`), Models 3-col grid, and Asterisk + AI Engine cards stretched to match Providers height via `self-stretch` + inner `justify-center h-full`. SVG T-junction arrow from AI Engine to Local AI Server uses col-span-4 with an explicit `<div aria-hidden="true" />` placeholder at row 2 col 5 to defeat CSS Grid auto-placement. Provider cards are grouped by type with multi-instance sub-rows so two `*_grok` or `*_google_live` instances are visually identifiable as the same provider kind. Provider identity (instance key + kind) is now surfaced on each card. Last-known `localAIModels` is preserved across transient probe failures via `?? prev.localAIModels` so the model name doesn't disappear when a single probe fails.
- **HelpTooltip backfill across the Admin UI (branch `codex/multi-instance-full-agent-providers`)**: ~260 inline tooltips added across the provider forms, Setup Wizard, and System pages. New `HelpTooltip` component supports both hover and click and is **viewport-aware**: it measures the trigger via `getBoundingClientRect` inside `useLayoutEffect`, flips the popover from above to below when the icon is near the top of a scrolled modal, and clamps horizontally to keep the popover on-screen. Coverage: Grok (17), OpenAI Realtime (24), Deepgram (22), ElevenLabs (10), Local (30), Google Live (29), Azure (21), OpenAI (17), Telnyx (7), Ollama (6); Setup Wizard (26); LLMPage (5), MCPPage (9), ProfilesPage (6), ModelsPage (12). The Add/Edit Provider modal also gets `autoComplete="off"` + `spellCheck={false}` on Provider Key / Display Name / Customer inputs and a dynamic Display Name placeholder per provider type (e.g. "Acme Deepgram" when editing Deepgram) so browser autocomplete doesn't leak stale values across providers.
- **Browser playback for compact call recordings (commit `f47728fd`)**: The admin UI Call Details modal now plays back `.ulaw` and uppercase `.WAV` recording files, in addition to the existing PCM `.wav` path. `.ulaw` files (Asterisk's compact 8 kHz μ-law output, ~10× smaller than PCM WAV) are wrapped in a browser-playable WAV container server-side via `audioop.ulaw2lin` (no transcode dependency). Uppercase `.WAV`, compressed WAVs, and `.gsm` files are routed through `sox` for transcode with `AAVA_RECORDING_TRANSCODE_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 120s) governing timeout. New `GET /api/calls/{record_id}/recording/audio` route alongside the legacy `/recording.wav` route — both go through the same `_recording_response` codec switch. Recording lookup now globs `*.{ulaw,wav,WAV,gsm}` instead of only `*.wav`. Pinned by `tests/test_admin_call_recordings.py`.
- **Custom (community) model entries via Admin UI (branch `model-catalog-improvements`, PR #359)**: Operators can now add LLM, TTS, or STT models that aren't in the curated catalog by pasting a HuggingFace download URL into a new "Community Models" panel on the Models page. Off by default (toggle persisted to `.env` as `ENABLE_CUSTOM_MODELS`); when enabled, custom entries are merged into `/api/wizard/local/available-models` with `source: "user"` so they appear in the existing STT/TTS/LLM tabs alongside curated entries with a yellow "Community" badge. Entries persist in `data/custom_models.json` (gitignored, survives container rebuilds and upgrades) with cross-process file locking via portalocker. Each custom model's on-disk filename is namespaced with the unique entry id (`custom_<type>_<slug>__<basename>`) so two community entries with the same upstream filename can't collide. For LLM GGUFs, an "Inspect GGUF header" expand panel reads the file's metadata after download and surfaces architecture, parameter count, quantization (Q4_K_M etc.), context length, layer count, file size, and an estimated RAM requirement (file size + KV cache + 1 GB headroom); architectures not in the verified-supported list (`llama`, `qwen2`, `qwen3`, `phi3`, `phi4`, `gemma`, `gemma2`, `mistral`, `mixtral`, `command-r`, `tinyllama`, etc.) get a yellow warning rather than blocking the download. Stdlib-only GGUF parser (no `gguf` PyPI dep — would have added 500 KB of model-conversion tooling we don't use). Three layers of path-traversal defence on the `/introspect` and `/delete-file` endpoints: hardcoded `_BASE_DIRS` lookup keyed on validated model type, conservative filename validation (rejects separators, `..`, control chars; allows Unicode for legitimate non-ASCII voices like piper pt_PT `tugão`), and a final resolved-path bounds check via `relative_to()`. `/delete-file` additionally verifies the `(type, model_path)` is in the curated catalog (and `source != "user"`) before unlinking — community models must go through `DELETE /custom-models/{id}` so the JSON entry stays in sync with disk state. Delete cleans up the main file plus all known sidecars (`.json` config for Piper TTS, `.sha256` integrity sidecar, `.download.json` archive metadata). HTTPS-only download URLs (rejects `http://` to prevent SSRF via redirect to internal addresses).
- **Piper TTS catalog: 110 new voices via regeneration script (branch `model-catalog-improvements`, PR #359)**: New `scripts/regenerate_piper_catalog.py` walks the `rhasspy/piper-voices` v1.0.0 repo on HuggingFace, pulls per-voice metadata (file size, `num_speakers`, sample rate from each `.onnx.json`), and emits Python dict literals in the same format as the existing `PIPER_TTS_MODELS` list. Stdlib-only with HF rate-limit handling (exponential backoff with `Retry-After` honoring including HTTP-date format), heuristic name-to-gender map for common Western/Indian/Persian names (~80 entries; everything else gets `gender: "unknown"`), title-case preservation for known abbreviations (MLS, VCTK, UPC, LibriTTS, Northern English Male, etc.), URL percent-encoding for non-ASCII voice names, and `--out FILE` output for human review before paste. Adds 110 new voice/quality combinations across ~25 languages including missing en-US (16 voices: libritts, ljspeech, hfc_*, john, kathleen, etc.), de-DE (7 incl. `thorsten_emotional` and `karlsson`), pl-PL (`darkman`, `mc_speech`, real `gosia`), ru-RU (3), fr-FR (5), and entirely new languages (cy-GB, es-AR, fa-IR, hi-IN, hu-HU, is-IS, ka-GE, lb-LU, lv-LV, ml-IN, ro-RO, sk-SK, sl-SI). `PIPER_TTS_MODELS` grew from 34 → 142 entries; full TTS catalog 54 → 162.
- **Catalog URL CI guardrail (branch `model-catalog-improvements`, PR #359)**: New `scripts/check_catalog_urls.py` walks the full catalog (STT + TTS + LLM, including Kokoro's nested `voice_files` dict) and HEADs every download URL in parallel with HF rate-limit backoff. New `.github/workflows/catalog-url-check.yml` runs it on PRs that touch `models_catalog.py` or the checker (blocks merge on any failure), weekly cron on `main` (Sundays 06:00 UTC; opens or comments on a single `catalog-broken` issue to avoid spam), and on manual dispatch. HTTPS-only scheme guard before every `urlopen` (rejects `file://`, `ftp://`, custom schemes that `urllib.request.urlopen` otherwise accepts). Catches the class of breakage that produced #358 (typo'd HF path) and the broader audit findings (Triangle104 deleted repo, Qwen official-vs-mirror split-file mismatches).
- **Pre-call & post-call tool execution tracking in Admin UI (branch `call-history-improvements`)**: Until now the call-detail modal in the Admin UI only surfaced *in-call* tool invocations (the ones the LLM issued via function calls). Pre-call enrichment lookups (CRM, customer-info HTTP fetches) and post-call webhooks (Discord notifications, generic webhooks, the dev SMS summary path) fired but their execution metadata never landed in the UI, so operators had no signal when a webhook silently 4xx'd or a CRM lookup timed out — they had to grep `docker logs ai_engine` to know whether downstream notifications actually delivered. Adds two new JSON columns to `call_records` (`pre_call_tool_calls`, `post_call_tool_calls`) populated via the existing call-history store with a new `append_phase_tool` / `update_phase_tool` round-trip that does read-modify-write under the existing lock — used by the post-call tool runner to amend the row after `_persist_call_history` completes. Engine cleanup is reordered so the call record persists *before* post-call tools fire, each post-call tool gets a `pending` placeholder up front, and the row is updated to `ok` / `error` / `timeout` / `skipped` on completion; per-tool budget enforced via `asyncio.wait_for` so hung tools can't leave permanent `pending` rows. Pre-call's `run_tool_with_timeout` now records execution metadata (status, duration_ms, error message) into a list saved on the session, copied onto `CallRecord.pre_call_tool_calls` at persist time — the existing `pre_call_results` lookup→prompt-var map is unchanged. New optional `PostCallTool.get_last_result()` / `PreCallTool.get_last_result()` hook (default returns None) lets a tool surface phase-specific diagnostics; `GenericWebhookTool` overrides it to expose HTTP status, body preview, and error string so the modal shows whether the webhook actually got a 200 back. Per-tool YAML `response_body_max_chars` overrides the global `CALL_HISTORY_RESPONSE_BODY_MAX_CHARS` env (default 512); `0` disables body capture entirely for sensitive endpoints. Backend `CallRecordResponse` exposes the two new lists with a defensive `_normalize_phase_tool_calls` helper that backfills `phase` on legacy rows. Frontend removed the old "Tool Calls Summary" chips + "Tool Call Details" sections and replaced with a single "Tool Executions (N)" section grouped by phase (Pre-call / In-call / Post-call) with status pills (ok/error/timeout/pending/skipped), duration, HTTP status, expandable diagnostics, and a manual Refresh button for sessions that still have `pending` entries. New `tests/test_call_history_phase_tools.py` (501 lines) covers schema migration on first start, append/update round-trip, concurrent updates, and webhook last_result capture across all exit paths. Backward-compat: existing call records render identically (empty post/pre-call lists hide the relevant subgroup), the new columns are nullable, the additive migration runs on first start, and tools without `get_last_result` simply produce records with `name`/`status`/`duration_ms` only. Admin UI requires a frontend rebuild on dev (`docker compose build admin_ui`); engine container needs only a normal recreate to pick up `src/` changes.
- **Generic webhook custom `summary_prompt` override (branch `call-history-improvements`)**: New optional `summary_prompt` field on `WebhookConfig` lets each post-call webhook override the default GPT system prompt that `generate_summary` uses; `{max_words}` is interpolated if present. Use cases include brand-perspective rewrites ("We discussed X" rather than the default "The caller asked about X"), addressing the AI agent by its product name (e.g. "Ava" rather than the generic "the AI agent"), and prepending vertical-specific framing for domain summaries. Behavior unchanged when the field is unset — falls back to the existing default prompt. Surfaces in YAML and the Admin UI Tools page; the dev demo SMS summary (`aava_sms_summary`) uses this to address callers as "we" / "us" and refer to the agent as "Ava" rather than "the caller / the AI agent".
- **`scripts/setup-vertex.sh` automated Google Vertex AI onboarding (branch `call-history-improvements`)**: New script replaces the 6-step GCP Console walkthrough that operators previously had to follow before `use_vertex_ai: true` would work. Single `bash scripts/setup-vertex.sh` invocation handles `gcloud` auth (with code-paste flow auto-detected on headless hosts so it works over SSH on FreePBX boxes), API enablement (`aiplatform.googleapis.com`, `iam.googleapis.com`), service account creation, role binding (`roles/aiplatform.user`), key download, and `.env` patching. Lists existing GCP projects and lets the operator pick, or walks them through creating a new project + linking billing account. `docs/Provider-Vertex-Setup.md` rewritten to lead with the script (~3 minutes for new operators) and keeps the manual Console flow as a fallback for environments where `gcloud` isn't available. `scripts/README.md` updated with the new entry.

### Fixed

- **Grok provider audio format + barge-in correctness (branch `codex/multi-instance-full-agent-providers`, PR #394)**: A series of live-call findings on voiprnd: (1) xAI's `response.output_audio.delta` is PCM16 @ 24 kHz, not μ-law as the audio path initially assumed — the first iteration used an RMS heuristic to guess the format which produced robotic audio on quiet samples; fixed by trusting the `session.update` output format declaration verbatim instead of probing. (2) xAI accepts μ-law/A-law input from AAVA without complaint but our path was double-base64-encoding before send; fixed by sending raw μ-law in a single base64 wrap. (3) Barge-in initially dropped the entire provider audio buffer on `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`, which cut off mid-sentence too aggressively; fixed by draining the buffered tail instead of flushing, then mirrored OpenAI Realtime's exact barge-in shape so behavior is consistent across providers. (4) Auto-hangup on farewell now also drops unsent provider burst so the call doesn't linger waiting for queued audio. Companion test: `tests/test_grok_realtime_provider.py`.
- **Grok provider tool-call event extraction (Codex P1 on PR #394)**: The provider dispatched tool-call events from `response.output_item.done` (which nests the function-call payload under `event["item"]`), but the tool adapter read the function-call fields from the top level — so the tool name and arguments would arrive as `None` and the tool would never run. Fixed by extracting from `event["item"]` first with a top-level fallback for defensive parity with OpenAI Realtime. Companion fix: VAD effective-state check now uses an `vad_explicitly_disabled` flag instead of `config.turn_detection is not None` because the session always sends a default `turn_detection` payload, so the prior check was unreachable.
- **Tooltip viewport-aware positioning (branch `codex/multi-instance-full-agent-providers`)**: Help tooltips opened from icons near the top of a scrolled modal (most visibly the Provider edit modal) were silently clipped above the viewport because the popover was always positioned with `bottom-full -left-28`. The new `HelpTooltip` measures the trigger via `getBoundingClientRect` inside `useLayoutEffect`, flips the popover from above to below when there's not enough room above, and clamps horizontally to keep the popover within the visible width with an 8 px margin. Recomputes on resize and any ancestor scroll (capture phase) so a scrolled modal opening a tooltip re-measures correctly.
- **Legacy single-instance full-agent YAML form categorization (branch `codex/multi-instance-full-agent-providers`)**: The Admin UI was incorrectly categorizing legacy single-instance full-agent provider entries (where the YAML key equals the kind, e.g. `openai_realtime:` or `grok:`) as modular pipeline slots, so they didn't get the full-agent form when edited. Fixed by accepting the legacy full-provider type name on canonical keys in the categorization helper. Single-instance setups now route to the correct form regardless of whether they use the legacy `openai_realtime:` block or the new explicit `type: openai_realtime` form.
- **Post-call tool error status now reflects tool diagnostics (branch `call-history-improvements`)**: Companion fix to the phase-tool tracking work above. `GenericWebhookTool` catches non-2xx HTTP responses internally and returns normally — by design (fire-and-forget so a downstream Discord 404 or CRM 5xx doesn't block the call from cleaning up). The engine's post-call status tracker relied solely on raised exceptions to flip status from default `ok`, so webhook failures (Discord 404, CRM 5xx, generic webhook timeouts on the receiving side, the dev SMS summary path getting a 502) all recorded as `ok` in the modal — operators saw green `ok` pills next to webhook calls that had silently failed and only learned otherwise by expanding each card and reading the JSON body. `GenericWebhookTool` already populated `_last_result['status']` with `error` on non-2xx responses, but the engine was reading that field and only honoring `skipped`. Engine now also honors `error` and `timeout` from the tool's own diagnostic surface. Affects every `PostCallTool` in the codebase (all currently route through `GenericWebhookTool`).
- **`local_ai_server` Dockerfile pin sync with `requirements.txt` (branch `call-history-improvements`)**: `local_ai_server/Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.gpu` had explicit `RUN pip install` lines for `sherpa-onnx` and `llama-cpp-python` that override `requirements.txt` at build time. Dependabot only updates the `requirements.txt` files, so without this sync a fresh image rebuild would silently regress to the older versions installed before #346/#362 (sherpa-onnx 1.12.39, llama-cpp-python 0.3.20) even though the requirements file said otherwise. Synced both Dockerfiles to sherpa-onnx 1.12.40 and llama-cpp-python 0.3.21. Same recurring footgun as #336 (a2fed450); long-term fix is to remove the explicit pip-install lines from the Dockerfiles entirely and rely solely on `requirements.txt` so Dependabot can keep them in sync — tracked separately.
- **Google Live setup wizard free-tier validation (#380)**: The Admin UI setup wizard no longer blocks Google Gemini Live setup when Google's `models.list` endpoint validates the API key but does not advertise any `bidiGenerateContent` models. Live model discovery is now advisory: the wizard warns, continues with `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-latest`, and documents that operators should verify Live API access, billing/quota, and model availability in AI Studio if runtime calls fail. Also adds `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` to the Admin UI model picker.
- **5 broken model download URLs (branch `model-catalog-improvements`, PR #359, closes #358)**: Reported in #358 (Gosia 404) and surfaced by full catalog audit. `piper_pl_gosia_medium` was pointing at `gosia_prosodic` on HuggingFace but the actual directory is `gosia` (also corrects `size_mb` from 100 → 60 to match the actual 63 MB file). `qwen25_7b` and `qwen25_14b` were pointing at the official `Qwen/...-GGUF` repos which only ship split files (e.g. `q4_k_m-00001-of-00002.gguf`); switched to single-file `bartowski/Qwen2.5-{7B,14B}-Instruct-GGUF` mirrors. `mistral_nemo_12b` was pointing at `Triangle104/Mistral_Nemo_Instruct_2407-GGUF` which returns 401 (repo deleted/private; Triangle104 has a history of purging models); switched to `bartowski/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-GGUF` and fixed the malformed `model_path` (`...gguf-Q4_K_M.gguf` double-extension was a copy-paste artifact).
- **Catalog Piper voice deduplication (branch `model-catalog-improvements`, PR #359)**: Two existing entries (`piper_ca_upc_medium` and `piper_sr_serbski_medium`) were silently pointing at the same `.onnx` file as new generated entries with different ids (different `model_path` shape but identical underlying file). Removed the new duplicates and corrected the legacy entries' metadata in place — the Catalan one was tagged "UPC (ca-ES, Multi)" / 100 MB but the file is the single-speaker upc_ona voice (~60 MB); the Serbian one was tagged "Serbski (sr-RS, Male)" / 100 MB but is the multi-speaker `serbski_institut` corpus (~73 MB). Legacy ids kept for backwards compatibility with operators who already selected these entries. The regeneration script now also dedupes by `model_path` so this class of collision can't recur on future refreshes.

## [6.5.1] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **CPU-demo profile: Faster-Whisper `tiny.en` + runtime toggles end-to-end (branch `full-local-cpu-improvements`, PR #386)**: Wires a low-resource Faster-Whisper `tiny.en` + Piper + Qwen 0.5B CPU profile through the Admin UI. Models page adds `tiny.en` to the STT dropdown and exposes new Device (`cpu`/`cuda`/`auto`) + Compute (`int8`/`float16`/`float32`) selectors for Faster-Whisper, with client-side gating that disables `float16` when device is `cpu` and snaps invalid pairs to `int8` so apply doesn't fail server-side after the long flow. Two new runtime toggles — Filler Audio and LLM/TTS Overlap — flip without reloading STT/LLM/TTS: enabling filler audio pre-synthesizes phrases via the active TTS backend, disabling clears the filler cache. Backend persists `FASTER_WHISPER_DEVICE`, `FASTER_WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE`, `LOCAL_ENABLE_FILLER_AUDIO`, `LOCAL_LLM_STREAMING_TTS_OVERLAP` to `.env` and forwards a new `runtime_config` block in the `switch_model` WS payload. Control plane skips no-op values and the admin layer accepts `no_change` as success so a runtime-only flip with the toggle in its current position no longer triggers a container recreate. Status response now exposes `models.stt.{device, compute_type}` (Faster-Whisper only) and `config.{enable_filler_audio, llm_streaming_tts_overlap}` so the Admin UI can verify runtime state matches request intent without rolling back working configurations on CUDA→CPU runtime fallback. CLI diagnostics (`agent check --local`, `local_test_report.py`) report the runtime device/compute/flags and dispatch the env-fallback STT model lookup on `LOCAL_STT_BACKEND` so reports stay correct under sherpa/vosk/whisper_cpp/tone/kroko in fallback mode.

### Fixed

- **Local provider audio hot path + reconnect hardening (branch `full-local-cpu-improvements`, PR #386)**: `send_audio()` previously awaited `_reconnect()` per audio frame on disconnect, blocking the producer for up to ~157s of backoff while audio kept arriving. Now drops the chunk, warns once per disconnect cycle, and kicks `_start_background_reconnect()` instead — gated on `self._was_connected` so we don't spin port-checks at frame rate for a server that was never reachable in this session. Switched send queue enqueue from `await put()` to `put_nowait()` with explicit `QueueFull` handling so a stalled queue can't backpressure-bomb the engine. Added an `asyncio.Lock` around `_reconnect()` so concurrent attempts from `send_audio` and the `_send_loop`'s direct on-`ConnectionClosed` path serialize and don't race on `self.websocket` / listener / sender task lifecycle. Hard-fails `start_session` and `send_initial_greeting` if the WebSocket isn't open after `initialize()` — re-raised after logging so callers can decide to drop the call instead of silently degrading. Narrowed STT fragment suppression in `full`/`llm` modes to clear filler only (`{a, an, the, then, uh, um, hmm}` as single words, or short phrases ending in `{uh, um, hmm}`) so common confirmations like `"ok"`, names, numbers, and short commands like `"do it"` pass through to the LLM.

- **Faster-Whisper verify path tolerates runtime CUDA→CPU fallback (branch `full-local-cpu-improvements`, PR #386)**: `local_ai_server` resets `faster_whisper_device`/`compute` to `cpu`/`int8` when CUDA model init fails. The admin verify path used to strict-match the request's requested device/compute against the runtime-reported values, treating a working CPU/int8 fallback as a verification failure and triggering a full env+yaml rollback + container recreate of an otherwise-loaded server. Verify now gates only on the model path (the hard "did this load" signal) and trusts the env file write to persist the operator's intent for the next restart; the Admin UI status panel still surfaces the actual runtime device/compute_type so the operator sees the discrepancy. The frontend CUDA compatibility gate also now reads `pendingSttExtra.device` (the user's pending dropdown selection) instead of only the persisted env value, so picking CUDA on a CPU-only host is caught client-side.

## [6.5.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **`tool_context` / `tool_result` WebSocket protocol v2 (#368, branch `release/v6.5.0-callpath`)**: Local LLM tool execution is now gated end-to-end. The engine sends `tool_context` (allowed tools, schemas, policy) at call start and `tool_result` after each tool runs; the local AI server suspends the post-tool LLM turn until the result arrives, then resumes with the tool's output injected into context. New message types documented in `docs/local-ai-server/PROTOCOL.md` and pinned by 11 jsonschema validation tests (`tests/test_local_ai_server_protocol_schema.py`). Cross-call ACL leakage guarded — `tool_context` is per-WebSocket and reused connections cannot inherit a prior call's allowlist; `_send_tool_context` and `_apply_system_prompt` both fail-closed (raise `RuntimeError` on send failure rather than running with stale state). Tool-result payloads are truncated to 4000 chars before LLM injection. Falsy tool results (`0`, `False`, `[]`, `None`) are preserved instead of being coerced to `{}`.
- **Deepgram Flux v2 turn-detection support (closes #370 enhancement scope)**: `flux-general-en` and `flux-general-multi` now correctly emit `version: "v2"` plus optional `eot_threshold` (range 0.5–0.9, default 0.7), `eager_eot_threshold` (range 0.3–0.9, must be `< eot_threshold`), and `keyterms` in the Voice Agent Settings JSON, per Deepgram's Configure Voice Agent docs. Pydantic enforces ranges + cross-field constraint at config load. Admin UI Providers page surfaces a "Flux Turn-Detection Tuning" panel automatically when a `flux-*` model is selected. 17 tests pinning Settings-builder behavior across Nova and Flux paths (`tests/test_deepgram_settings_listen_provider.py`).
- **Gemini 3.1 Flash Live verified compatible (#350, #356)**: `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` works without engine changes. The 3.1 server-content shape sometimes delivers multiple top-level keys in a single envelope (`modelTurn` audio + `outputTranscription` + `turnComplete` together), versus 2.5's single-keyed pattern; AAVA's existing `_handle_server_content` parser handles this correctly because each top-level key is iterated independently with no early returns. 9 pytest-asyncio tests + 2.5 single-keyed regressions pin this property (`tests/test_google_live_multi_part_serverContent.py`).

### Changed

- **Deepgram listen model default is now `nova-3`**: aligned across `config/ai-agent.yaml`, `DeepgramProviderConfig` Pydantic, `ProvidersPage.tsx` creation default, `DeepgramProviderForm.tsx` UI, the setup wizard, the example/golden YAMLs, and the `/options/deepgram` admin API catalog. Pre-v6.5.0 the Deepgram Voice Agent provider hardcoded `nova-3` in the Settings JSON regardless of the YAML `model:` field; v6.5.0 makes the YAML field actually apply. **Upgrade note:** operators who explicitly set `model: nova-2` in their YAML will see Deepgram move to Nova-2 *for real* on this upgrade — see `docs/Provider-Deepgram-Setup.md` for the full upgrade-behavior callout.
- **Admin UI HTTP-tool-test guard now reads `.env` first (#370)**: `AAVA_HTTP_TOOL_TEST_ALLOW_PRIVATE`, `AAVA_HTTP_TOOL_TEST_ALLOW_HOSTS`, `AAVA_HTTP_TOOL_TEST_FOLLOW_REDIRECTS` edits made via the Admin UI Environment page take effect on the next test request without requiring an `ai_engine` container restart. Helper functions (`_dotenv_value`, `_env_bool`, `_env_csv_set`) fail closed on `.env` read failure (return the default rather than silently consulting `os.environ`). 4 regression tests in `admin_ui/backend/tests/test_http_tool_test_security.py`.
- **`send_tool_result` and `_send_tool_context` return `bool`**: transport failures on the local-AI-server WebSocket now surface to the engine instead of silently stalling the post-tool turn. Engine logs a warning when the result-send returns `False`; tool-context send raises `RuntimeError` so call setup aborts with stale state visible.

### Fixed

- **#351 Google Live barge-in (documentation-only resolution)**: production answer is `use_vertex_ai: true` plus the GA `gemini-live-2.5-flash-native-audio` model. Vertex AI's GA Live model fires `serverContent.interrupted` reliably during caller overlap; the Developer API's `*-native-audio-latest` preview alias does not. The differentiator is the model variant published per platform, not AAVA's code path. AAVA's TTS-input gating still applies unconditionally — a `vad_mode`-aware silence-gating refactor is tracked for v6.6 (the experiment in `1763a441` was reverted in `cead273a` because the AudioSocket forwarding path has downstream coupling to silence injection / `vad_manager` that needs a broader audio-path overhaul).
- **Vad-state access guard narrowed**: replaced a broad `try/except Exception` around `session.vad_state.get("output_suppression")` in the engine's `AgentAudioDone` handler with an `isinstance(vad_state, dict)` check. `dict.get()` doesn't raise; the broad guard was masking real errors.
- **Slow-tool cross-call correlation (local AI server)**: tool dispatch now plumbs the originating `call_id` through `send_tool_result(...)`, so a slow tool returning after the provider-global "active call" has rolled over still routes its result to the correct session instead of the newer call's. Engine handles old-signature providers via a narrowed `TypeError` guard that only catches the specific `unexpected keyword argument 'call_id'` message.



### Added

- **Microsoft Calendar tool V1 (branch `microsoft-calendar`)**: Added a Microsoft 365 Outlook calendar tool using device-code OAuth, with Admin UI Connect/Verify/Disconnect flow, per-context account binding, native Microsoft Graph free/busy availability by default, working-hours masks, slot caps, event-duration guardrails, quiet `create_event` spoken messages plus `agent_hint`, server-side delete fallback for hallucinated event ids, locked MSAL token-cache handling across `admin_ui` and `ai_engine`, provider-agnostic demo-context scheduling prompts, and docs covering Azure public-client setup. V1 supports one work/school Microsoft 365 account (`accounts.default`) with explicit tenant ID; personal Outlook.com and tenant-wide application permissions are intentionally out of scope.
- **Google Calendar — event-id surfaced in create_event message + server-side delete fallback (branch `calendar-improvements`, round-5 fix)**: Two-layer defense against a real bug seen in voiprnd round-5 testing where Gemini followed the new "delete-then-recreate on caller correction" rule but **hallucinated** the event_id (passed `f0l1q7d4j1t5n0b4h3c2a1m0` instead of the real id from the prior `create_event` success), and Google returned 404. **(behavior change)** `create_event` success message now includes the event id verbatim: *"Event created with id 'XYZ'. To modify or delete this event later, call delete_event with this exact event_id — do not invent or guess one."* Models that read the message field (most do) can no longer miss it. Aliased as `event_id` on the response too. **(server-side safety net)** `GCalendarTool` now tracks the most-recent successful `create_event` per `call_id` (in-memory, threadsafe). If `delete_event` returns 404 and we have a tracked id from the same call, the tool falls back to deleting that one instead and returns success with a message that explains the recovery so the model self-corrects on subsequent attempts. Tracking entry is cleared on first successful delete or fallback to avoid double-fallback edge cases.
- **Engine — date/time prompt placeholders for scheduling reasoning (branch `calendar-improvements`, round-4 fix)**: New template variables resolved per-call inside `_apply_prompt_template_substitution`: `{current_date}` ('2026-04-24'), `{current_weekday}` ('Friday'), `{current_time}` ('22:35'), `{current_datetime_iso}` (UTC), and `{today}` ('Friday, April 24, 2026'). Same substitution path every prompt already goes through, so all 5 demo contexts and any user-defined contexts get them automatically. Resolves real bugs surfaced by live testing: local_hybrid model passing `time_min: '2023-04-28...'` (model thought current year was 2023), and ElevenLabs/Claude saying *"Tuesday April 27"* when April 27, 2026 is actually a Monday. Companion update injects `Today is {today}` into the SCHEDULING block of all 5 demo contexts, plus a delete-then-recreate rule for caller corrections (*"FIRST call delete_event with the prior event_id, THEN call create_event with the corrected time"*) and an explicit retry directive for `duration_too_long` / `invalid_duration` / `missing_parameters` errors so models don't bail to "calendar not configured" on recoverable parameter errors.
- **Google Calendar — event duration cap + calendar-timezone surfaced explicitly (branch `calendar-improvements`, round-3 fix)**: Two related correctness bugs surfaced by live ElevenLabs testing: (1) agent picked the right slot start (11 AM) but passed `end_datetime: '2026-04-27T18:00:00Z'` — booked a **7-hour meeting** because the schema described `end_datetime` as just "ISO 8601 end time" with no constraint that it equal start + slot duration; (2) the legacy `Free slot starts: …` message had no timezone info so models defaulted to UTC, and our lenient datetime parser silently strips any TZ tail and treats wall-clock as calendar-local — by coincidence the correct slot, but the model's reasoning was wrong. Four-layer fix: slot-list message uses START–END pairs and includes the calendar timezone name (`Free 30-minute slots (America/Los_Angeles): 2026-04-27 09:00–09:30, 10:00–10:30, 11:00–11:30. All times are in America/Los_Angeles. When booking via create_event, pass start_datetime and end_datetime as the SAME local-time strings (no Z, no offset) and set end_datetime = start_datetime + 30 minutes.`); new `slots_with_end`, `slot_duration_minutes`, and `calendar_timezone` fields on the structured response for models that read JSON; schema descriptions for `start_datetime` / `end_datetime` / `time_min` / `time_max` now spell out the duration constraint and TZ-strip behavior with worked examples; server-side guard refuses events with non-positive duration (`error_code: invalid_duration`) or duration > 240 minutes (`error_code: duration_too_long`, configurable via `tools.google_calendar.max_event_duration_minutes`).
- **Google Calendar — operator's blank or absent free_prefix forces free/busy mode regardless of LLM (branch `calendar-improvements`, round-2.5 fix)**: Live test on voiprnd: operator cleared Free prefix in Tools UI (saved as `free_prefix: ''`) but `availability_mode` kept showing `title_prefix` because Gemini auto-filled `free_prefix='Open'` from the schema example on every call — LLM-supplied per-call value won over the (correctly) blank config. Two-layer fix. Schema description rewritten to be assertive (*"DO NOT PASS unless the operator explicitly told you to use a title-based scheme; default behavior uses Google native free/busy and you should OMIT this parameter entirely"*) — fixes 90% of cases where well-behaved LLMs respect schema-level guidance. Defense-in-depth: a SINGLE canonical rule replaces the prior precedence dance. **`tools.google_calendar.free_prefix` empty (`''`) or absent means free/busy mode; any non-empty value means title-prefix mode using that value.** The operator's choice always wins over LLM-supplied values — the LLM may *narrow* the prefix string within an already-active title-prefix mode, but it cannot escape free/busy by passing `'Open'` when the operator has cleared the field. (CodeRabbit aligned with this rule on the second review pass — the previous behavior distinguished blank-vs-absent in subtle ways and was a source of operator confusion.)
- **Google Calendar — slot-count cap, native free/busy fallback, sharper error guidance (branch `calendar-improvements`)**: Three changes from live test calls on voiprnd. **(behavior change)** `get_free_slots` now caps how many slot start-times it returns to the LLM (default `max_slots_returned: 3`, configurable in Tools UI; set to `0` to disable). Without a cap, `get_free_slots` over a multi-day window can return 20+ ISO timestamps which the model dutifully reads aloud — matched a live-call user complaint about *"the agent kept speaking free slots over and over"* that traced to a single 8-slot tool response (≈2 minutes of robotic recitation). When the list is truncated, the response message now nudges the model: *"showing N of M available; propose 2-3 of these to the caller — do not read the full list."* **(behavior change)** Leaving `free_prefix` blank now switches `get_free_slots` from title-prefix scanning to Google's native free/busy API (`freebusy.query()`) intersected with a working-hours mask (default Mon–Fri 09:00–17:00 in calendar timezone, configurable via YAML keys `working_hours_start` / `working_hours_end` / `working_days`). Operators no longer need to seed "Open" availability events — the tool just queries Google for busy periods inside business hours. Existing configs with `free_prefix: 'Open'` keep their behavior; the mode switch is implicit. New `availability_mode` field on the response identifies which mode ran. **(behavior change)** `get_free_slots` parameter-error message now includes an explicit retry instruction (`"Retry with ISO 8601 time_min and time_max — do NOT tell the caller the calendar is not configured"`) and an `error_code: missing_parameters` field. Live tests showed gpt-4o-mini (Deepgram think stage) and other providers calling `get_free_slots` with `time_min=null, time_max=null` and then misinterpreting the generic error as "calendar not configured", incorrectly bailing to the email-the-maintainer fallback. Companion change tightens the SCHEDULING-block fallback prompt across all five demo contexts: only fire the "calendar not configured" path on responses containing `not configured` / `no credentials` / `403` / `forbidden` / `unavailable`; for any other tool error, retry or apologize and offer a different time.
- **Google Calendar — Codex review fixes (branch `calendar-improvements`)**: Seven fixes from Codex's pre-PR review of the calendar-improvements branch. **(P1, correctness, behavior change)** `GCalendar.list_events()` now raises a typed `GoogleCalendarApiError` on uninitialized service or API failure instead of silently returning `[]`. With the new structured `get_free_slots` response, swallowing API errors as empty would have made revoked shares, expired DWD tokens, or transient API failures look like `no_open_windows` / `fully_booked` business outcomes. Callers in `gcal_tool` catch the exception and return structured error responses; per-calendar in aggregations they're added to `failed_keys` (which fails closed in `aggregate_mode='all'`). **(P2, behavior change)** Backend default for `min_slot_duration_minutes` is now `30` (was `15`) to match the UI default and what docs always advertised. YAML configs with explicit values keep them. **(P2)** `get_free_slots` empty response in multi-calendar `aggregate_mode='all'` now distinguishes "calendar X has no Open blocks" from "all calendars are fully booked" by tracking per-calendar block counts. New `calendars_without_open_windows` array in the response. **(P2)** Verify endpoint initializes `subject` from persisted config before applying POST-body overrides — previously API callers omitting `subject` would verify without impersonation. **(P2)** `/info` endpoint accepts `credentials_path` query parameter for unsaved manual path edits, symmetric with `/verify`'s POST-body override. **(P2)** Verify result UI tracks a fingerprint of the verified `(path, calendar_id, timezone, subject)` tuple and clears the green check when any verified field changes — previously a stale ✓ could persist after edits. **(P3)** Legacy single-calendar `_get_cal()` path now includes `subject` in cache key, consistent with the multi-calendar `_get_or_create_cal()`.
- **Google Calendar — Domain-Wide Delegation support (Phase 1, branch `calendar-improvements`)**: Optional `subject` field per calendar entry enables Workspace impersonation via `creds.with_subject()`. Required setup at admin.google.com (Security → API controls → Domain-wide delegation) is documented in the Tools UI directly: an expandable "🪪 Domain-Wide Delegation (advanced)" disclosure per row exposes the impersonation field, links to the admin console setup page, and surfaces the SA's `client_id` (not email — the #1 setup pitfall) for paste-into-admin-console. New `dwd_not_configured` error code distinguishes DWD-misconfigured from generic auth failures. Critical correctness fix: `subject` is now part of the GCalendar instance cache key, so switching impersonation targets no longer reuses the wrong cached client (Codex feedback). Three regression tests pin the cache-key shape. Verify endpoint forces a token refresh before calling Calendar API so DWD-not-configured failures surface at config time, not at first call. Auto-verify on subject blur lets operators see DWD setup mistakes immediately. Use DWD when a Workspace policy blocks "share calendar with service account email" external sharing — otherwise the simpler share flow remains the recommended path.
- **Google Calendar — JSON upload + auto-discover (Phase 0b, branch `calendar-improvements`)**: The Tools page Google Calendar section now has per-row **📁 Upload JSON** buttons (becoming **Replace JSON** when a path is already set). Uploading triggers a single backend round-trip that (1) writes the SA file to `secrets/` with a stable-hash filename keyed off `client_email` so re-uploading the same SA reuses the same path (private-key rotation just works), (2) authenticates as the SA and calls `calendarList.list()` to discover which calendars the SA has been shared with, and (3) returns identity + container path + accessible calendars. The UI then auto-fills `Credentials Path`, `Calendar ID`, and `Timezone` when exactly one calendar is accessible (the 90% case — operator types nothing); shows a dropdown picker when multiple are accessible; or surfaces a yellow callout with the SA email and the share-with instruction when zero are accessible. New `DELETE /api/config/google-calendar/credentials/{filename}` endpoint with strict path-traversal protection (filename must match the stable-hash pattern). The legacy manual SCP-and-paste path is preserved as a fallback for operators with custom secret mounts.
- **Google Calendar — Tools UI polish + Verify (Phase 0a, branch `calendar-improvements`)**: Three quality-of-life additions on the Tools page Google Calendar section. (1) `free_prefix`, `busy_prefix`, and `min_slot_duration_minutes` are now exposed as input fields with sensible defaults (`Open` / `Busy` / `30`); they were previously YAML-only since PR #250, and operators using only the UI couldn't configure them — `get_free_slots` errored with "prefix required" in that case. Backend now also defaults to `Open`/`Busy` when neither LLM nor config sets them, so the tool works out of the box. Empty-string config is treated as "use default" so clearing a field doesn't break behavior. (2) Each calendar row now auto-displays the service account identity (`client_email` for sharing the calendar, `client_id` for Domain-Wide Delegation setup at admin.google.com) with copy buttons, eliminating the need to grep the JSON file manually. (3) Per-row 🩺 **Verify access** button POSTs the current form state to a new `/api/config/google-calendar/{key}/verify` endpoint that uses raw `googleapiclient` (not the swallow-everything `GCalendar` wrapper) and returns distinct error codes (`forbidden_calendar`, `calendar_not_found`, `auth_failed`, `credentials_file_not_found`, etc.) with actionable messages. Drift warning fires if the configured timezone doesn't match the calendar's actual timezone (a silent footgun previously). Verify accepts unsaved form state via the POST body so operators can test edits without saving first.
- **Google Calendar — structured `get_free_slots` empty response**: The `get_free_slots` action now returns a structured shape with `slots`, `open_windows_found`, `busy_blocks_found`, and `reason` fields in addition to the legacy `message`. The `reason` distinguishes the two distinct empty-result causes — `no_open_windows` (operator hasn't scheduled availability blocks on the calendar) vs `fully_booked` (open windows exist but are entirely covered by busy events) — letting the LLM react appropriately. The legacy `"Free slot starts: …"` `message` text is preserved verbatim for the available case so existing prompt templates that pattern-match on it keep working.
- **Google Live voice picker — full 30-voice catalog (#349)**: Expanded the `google_live` TTS voice picker in the admin UI from 8 hardcoded voices (split arbitrarily into Female/Male) to the full 30-voice catalog that Gemini native-audio Live models support. Voices are labeled with Google's official tone descriptors (Bright, Firm, Smooth, Warm, etc.) from the [speech-generation docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/speech-generation), listed alphabetically. Female/Male grouping dropped since Google does not publish gender metadata for these voices. Help text updated ("24 languages" → "70+ languages") to match Google's current multilingual capability. Default voice `Aoede` preserved; no backend changes — the `google_live` provider already accepts any string, so all 22 new voices work with existing operator YAML configs unchanged.
- **Google Calendar — Multi-Account / Per-Context Calendar Selection (#338)**: Single deployments can now serve multiple separate Google Calendars (e.g. one per business line, one per agent persona) and bind each Admin UI Context to exactly one calendar. New nested config shape `tools.google_calendar.calendars: {<key>: {credentials_path, calendar_id, timezone}}` replaces the legacy single-calendar root fields (which still work as a fallback materialized as `calendars.default`). Per-context binding via `contexts.<name>.tool_overrides.google_calendar.selected_calendars: [<key>]` — UI enforces single-select (others greyed out) so the LLM never has to disambiguate. Tool actions (`list_events`, `get_event`, `create_event`, `delete_event`) accept an optional `calendar_key` to target a specific calendar in YAML-configured multi-calendar setups; `get_free_slots` accepts `aggregate_mode` (`all` = intersection / "free on every calendar", `any` = union) for cross-calendar availability use cases. Admin UI Tools page consolidates legacy single-calendar fields and the multi-account list into one unified **Calendars** section with `+ Add Calendar`, per-row inline editing with stable draft-key UX (rename only commits on blur/Enter), and automatic propagation of key renames/deletions into every `selected_calendars` reference in contexts. Empty-state hint communicates that `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_*` env vars still apply when no calendars are explicitly configured. Docs include two ready-to-adapt sample system prompt templates (single-calendar appointment agent, multi-calendar YAML escape hatch) covering timezone discipline, `get_free_slots` defaults, booking confirmation read-back, and explicit `calendar_key` guidance for the multi-calendar prompt path.

### Fixed

- **Google Live voice picker data-loss footgun (#349)**: Voice picker now renders a "Custom" optgroup for YAML-configured voices outside the 30-voice Gemini catalog (e.g. a new Google voice before we ship a UI update), mirroring the existing pattern on the model picker. Previously, a controlled `<select>` with a value not matching any `<option>` fell through to browser-default rendering (first option selected visually while React state held the configured value), so operators "fixing" the mismatched display silently overwrote their YAML-set custom voice on save.
- **Google Calendar — duplicate events (3x) for a single booking request (#338)**: The OpenAI Realtime API only commits `function_call` items to the conversation on `response.done`; our adapter was submitting `function_call_output` immediately when a fast tool finished (calendar create ~300–500 ms), racing ahead of that commit. The server then rejected the output with `invalid_tool_call_id` ("Tool call ID … not found in conversation"), the LLM treated the call as un-acknowledged, and re-emitted it under a fresh `call_id` — running the (non-idempotent) tool a second and third time before giving up. Fix gates `function_call_output` submission on a per-`response_id` `asyncio.Event` that is set when the parent response is finalized (`response.done`/`completed`/`cancelled`/`error`); the tool still executes in parallel with the response committal so latency in the common case is unchanged. Shared `_await_parent_response_done()` helper applied to both the success path and the exception path (a tool exception used to bypass the gate). Sentinel cleanup is now centralized in the `response.done` handler so multi-`function_call` responses don't have one waiter pop the sentinel out from under its siblings. Reconnect path (`_reconnect_with_backoff`) and `stop_session` both release pending sentinels so stale handlers don't post stale outputs onto a new socket.
- **Per-context `tool_overrides.*` were silently ignored on OpenAI Realtime, Deepgram, and Google Live (#338)**: `ToolExecutionContext.context_name` was never threaded from the session through the provider into the tool execution context for these three providers (only ElevenLabs handled it). `gcal_tool._get_config()` saw `ctx_name=None`, skipped the overlay fetch, and effectively used the global tool config for every context — most visibly, `selected_calendars: ['calendar_2']` in an Edit Context modal had no effect, and bookings always landed in the first calendar. Fix injects `provider._context_name = session.context_name` in `engine.py` alongside the existing tool-context attrs, propagates `context_name` through the provider's tool-call context dict, and forwards it into `ToolExecutionContext` from both OpenAI and Deepgram adapters (Google Live constructs the context directly). The fix is provider-agnostic in scope: any tool that reads a per-context override (transfer destinations, custom webhook URLs, etc.) on these providers now receives it correctly where it was previously silently discarded.
- **Google Calendar — `legacy_single` guard read root credentials when a nested `calendars.default` was configured (#338)**: The single-cal backward-compat path matched any one-entry resolved calendar map with key `default`, including the new nested `tools.google_calendar.calendars.default` shape. In that case the tool built its `GCalendar` from root-level legacy fields (env-var path) instead of the configured nested entry, so a valid single-calendar multi-account config silently used the wrong credentials. Fix narrows `legacy_single` to require an absent or empty `calendars` dict at the config root, matching `_resolve_calendars`' truthiness semantics so both branches agree on what "legacy" means.
- **Google Calendar — `get_free_slots` widened on `aggregate_mode="all"` when a calendar was unavailable (#338)**: Default intersection mode silently dropped unreachable calendars from the per-calendar interval list, transforming the result from "free on every selected calendar" into "free on every reachable calendar" and surfacing slots that were actually busy on the unavailable one. Now fails closed with an explicit error listing the unreachable calendars; `aggregate_mode="any"` (union) still proceeds since a partial union is still a valid subset of the full union.
- **Google Calendar — `list_events` returned `"status": "success"` with hidden missing data when selected calendars were unavailable (#338)**: The per-calendar list helper treated a missing service as an empty calendar and returned `[]`, so the merged response looked complete but silently omitted events from any calendar whose API client failed to initialize. Now fails closed for both the multi-calendar aggregate path and the targeted-`calendar_key` path with the list of unreachable calendars.
- **Admin UI — stale `selected_calendars` could lock the Edit Context UI (#338)**: A saved selection pointing at a removed calendar made `hasSelection=true` while no rendered checkbox was selected, disabling every option (single-select greys out non-selected rows) so the user couldn't recover from the form. Fix introduces `selectedCalKeysInOptions` (filtered against the live `googleCalKeys`) and routes the disable logic through it; stale keys are silently dropped on the next interaction. The backend `_selected_calendar_keys()` already filters to valid keys, so a stale entry was never authoritative server-side either.
- **OpenAI Realtime — `invalid_tool_call_id` rejections noisy at ERROR level (#338)**: The known-benign post-`response.done` race that occasionally still fires (server-side conversation commit lags `response.done` emission to clients) used to log at ERROR. The follow-up `response.create` we issue with explicit instructions still produces audio so user experience is unaffected, but the ERROR noise drowned out real issues. Now correlates the rejected `call_id` against a 30 s TTL window of recently-observed function_call IDs (`_recent_tool_call_ids`): a known id downgrades to WARNING with a self-explanatory "benign race — audio response still succeeds" message; an unknown id (e.g. dropped on reconnect, missed sentinel registration, timeout fallback) stays at ERROR so genuine failures remain visible.

### Migration notes (calendar-improvements branch)

The calendar-improvements PR is **deliberately back-compatible** for the common
configurations. This section calls out the few behavior changes that operators
upgrading from a pre-`calendar-improvements` build should know about, and the
quick fixes if any of them affect your deployment.

- **Default `min_slot_duration_minutes` changed from 15 → 30.** Codex review
  fix. Existing YAML configs with an explicit `tools.google_calendar.min_slot_duration_minutes`
  value keep that value. Operators relying on the backend-default 15-minute
  slots will see 30-minute slots after upgrade. Quick fix: set
  `min_slot_duration_minutes: 15` in YAML or in the Tools UI.
- **New `max_slots_returned` cap (default 3).** `get_free_slots` now returns
  at most 3 slot start-times to the LLM unless reconfigured. Pre-PR behavior
  returned all available slots. Most callers will not notice — the model
  doesn't need 20 slots — but if you have a custom prompt template that
  expects to enumerate more, set `tools.google_calendar.max_slots_returned`
  in YAML or in the Tools UI (set to `0` to disable the cap entirely).
- **New `max_event_duration_minutes` cap (default 240).** `create_event`
  refuses bookings with duration > 4 hours by default. If you legitimately
  book longer events through this tool, set
  `tools.google_calendar.max_event_duration_minutes` to a higher value (or
  `0` to disable). The cap exists because LLMs were observed booking 7-hour
  meetings when the schema didn't specify duration constraint.
- **`free_prefix` blank means free/busy mode (was: title-prefix with
  default `'Open'`).** Operators with `free_prefix: 'Open'` (or any non-
  empty value) in YAML keep title-prefix mode unchanged — the most common
  case. Operators with `free_prefix: ''` set explicitly, or no
  `free_prefix` configured at all, will switch to Google's native
  free/busy API intersected with a Mon–Fri 09:00–17:00 working-hours mask.
  This is generally what they want (no need to seed "Open" events) but the
  switch is a real behavior change. To stay on title-prefix mode, set
  `free_prefix: 'Open'` (or any non-empty string) explicitly in YAML or
  the Tools UI. Working hours are tunable via `working_hours_start` /
  `working_hours_end` / `working_days`.
- **Slot-list message format extended; legacy `"Free slot starts:"` prefix
  preserved.** Prompt templates that pattern-match on the literal string
  `"Free slot starts:"` keep working — that token is still the opening
  prefix of the message. The string is now followed by additional
  duration/timezone guidance the LLM can use. If your prompt logic parses
  the *entire* message rather than just matching the prefix, review the
  new format documented in `docs/Google-calendar-tool.md` under
  `get_free_slots response shape`.
- **`create_event` success message extended; `"Event created."` prefix
  preserved.** The new message starts with `"Event created with id 'XYZ'. ..."`.
  Templates matching on `"Event created"` substring keep working; templates
  matching the exact full string `"Event created."` should switch to a
  prefix or substring match.
- **New response fields are purely additive.** `slots_with_end`,
  `slot_duration_minutes`, `calendar_timezone`, `availability_mode`,
  `total_slots_available`, `slots_truncated`, `event_id` (alias of `id` on
  create_event), `error_code` on error responses — none of these break
  existing consumers.
- **Schema description rewrites are LLM-visible only.** The model re-reads
  the schema each session, so changes take effect on the next call without
  any operator action. The biggest behavioral change here is `free_prefix`'s
  description telling the model not to auto-pass it; well-behaved LLMs
  comply, and the operator-blank-override defends against ones that don't.
- **Typed `GoogleCalendarApiError` is internal.** API failures that used to
  silently return `[]` now propagate as a typed exception caught and
  surfaced as structured errors to the LLM. No change to the public
  response shape; just makes runtime failures (revoked SA share, expired
  DWD token) distinguishable from genuine business-empty results in logs.

If you're upgrading and want to keep maximum back-compat without thinking
about any of the above, set the following in `tools.google_calendar`:

```yaml
tools:
  google_calendar:
    free_prefix: Open                  # keep title-prefix mode
    busy_prefix: Busy                  # keep busy-block scanning
    min_slot_duration_minutes: 15      # restore pre-PR slot grid
    max_slots_returned: 0              # disable slot cap (return all)
    max_event_duration_minutes: 0      # disable duration cap
```

That config produces exact pre-PR behavior except for the `event_id`-in-message
nudge, which is non-breaking.

### Planned

- Additional provider integrations
- Enhanced monitoring features

## [6.4.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **CPU-Only Latency Optimization — Streaming LLM→TTS Overlap (#301)**: Reduces perceived response latency from 3-10s to sub-2s on pipeline configurations by overlapping LLM token generation with per-sentence TTS synthesis. Instead of waiting for the full LLM response before starting TTS, tokens are streamed and split at sentence boundaries (`.!?`), with each sentence synthesized and played immediately. Includes multi-chunk TTS protocol extension (`utterance_id`, `chunk_index`, `is_final` metadata fields — backward compatible), `supports_streaming` capability flag on LLM adapters (currently OpenAI-compatible only), and per-call tool state isolation for concurrent streaming sessions. Tested and validated on voiprnd with Google Live, Deepgram, OpenAI Realtime, and Local Hybrid (Qwen3-30B + Piper) pipelines.
- **Pipeline Filler Audio**: Play a brief acknowledgment phrase (e.g. "One moment please.") via the pipeline's TTS adapter immediately when a user turn is detected, before LLM inference starts. Provides instant perceived responsiveness. Filler uses the same TTS voice as real responses (Piper/Kokoro/etc.), not eSpeak. Configurable via `streaming.pipeline_filler_enabled` and `streaming.pipeline_filler_phrases` in `ai-agent.yaml`. Admin UI toggle on Streaming page.
- **Direct PCM→µ-law Conversion**: `pcm16_to_ulaw_8k()` static method in `AudioProcessor` bypasses WAV file roundtrip in all 5 TTS backends (Piper, Kokoro, MeloTTS, Silero, Matcha). Saves 10-50ms per TTS call by eliminating disk I/O.
- **eSpeak NG Backend**: New `EspeakNGBackend` class in `tts_backends.py` for ultra-fast filler phrase synthesis. Uses `espeak-ng --stdout` with in-memory WAV parsing (no temp files, no sox subprocess). Falls back gracefully when eSpeak is unavailable.
- **TTS Phrase Cache**: Optional in-memory cache for repeated short phrases (greetings, confirmations). LRU eviction at 256 entries, cache key includes backend + model path + voice/speaker params. Cleared on `reload_models()`. Enable via `LOCAL_TTS_PHRASE_CACHE_ENABLED=true` env var.
- **Qwen 2.5-1.5B Instruct as Recommended CPU LLM**: New model catalog entry (`qwen25_1_5b`, 940MB Q4_K_M). Achieves ~15-30 tok/s on CPU vs Phi-3's ~0.8 tok/s. Reliable `hangup_call` tool execution via heuristic parsing. ChatML format. Setup Wizard auto-recommends for CPU-only deployments with "⚡ CPU Recommended" badge. Default LLM path updated in `config.py`. `model_setup.sh` updated for light/medium CPU tiers (Phi-3 and TinyLlama kept as fallbacks).
- **LLM Streaming in Local AI Server**: `process_llm_chat_streaming()` async generator yields tokens from `llama-cpp-python`'s `create_chat_completion(stream=True)` via asyncio.Queue + thread executor. Idle timeout prevents `_llm_lock` from being held indefinitely. Used by `_process_full_pipeline_streaming()` for sentence-by-sentence TTS in full mode.
- **OpenAI LLM Adapter Streaming**: `generate_stream()` on `OpenAILLMAdapter` streams tokens via SSE with tool call accumulation from `delta.tool_calls`. Falls back to non-streaming for realtime transport mode.
- **Admin UI Latency Settings**: New "Latency Optimization" section on Streaming page with toggles for pipeline streaming overlap, pipeline filler audio, and filler phrase configuration. Max latency display added to Call History detail view.

### Fixed

- **Barge-in config regression**: Barge-in thresholds were accidentally hardened globally (`energy_threshold` 1000→3000, `initial_protection_ms` 200→1500, etc.) affecting all providers. Reverted to responsive pre-branch values.
- **Config defaults for host networking**: Reverted `advertise_host: ai_engine` and `ws_url: ws://local_ai_server:8765` back to `127.0.0.1` / `${LOCAL_WS_URL:-ws://127.0.0.1:8765}`. Docker service names only resolve in bridge networking; host networking (the default) requires `127.0.0.1`. This caused "Allocation failed" on AudioSocket originate for all users on host networking.
- **Filler audio slot conflict**: Filler audio occupied the streaming playback slot, blocking the real LLM→TTS streaming session. Fixed by calling `stop_streaming_playback` after filler completes, with `tts_ended_ts` backdated to avoid the post-TTS echo protection dead zone.
- **Tool calls lost during streaming**: When the LLM returned both text and tool calls (e.g. farewell + `hangup_call`), `generate_stream()` consumed the text but tool call deltas were silently dropped. Agent would say goodbye but never hang up. Fixed by accumulating `delta.tool_calls` from SSE chunks per-call and executing after playback.
- **Streaming capability detection**: `hasattr(adapter, "generate_stream")` was always true because the base `LLMComponent` defines a default. Replaced with `supports_streaming` class attribute. Non-streaming adapters (local_llm, ollama) now correctly use the serial path.
- **TTS phrase cache non-functional UI toggle**: The StreamingPage toggle wrote to `config.local_ai_server.*` in YAML, but `local_ai_server` reads from `LOCAL_TTS_PHRASE_CACHE` env var. Removed broken toggle (setting managed via `.env`).
- **pcm16_to_ulaw_8k fallback data corruption**: If `audioop.ratecv` succeeded but `lin2ulaw` failed, the fallback WAV wrapper used the already-resampled data with the original sample rate. Now preserves original PCM data for fallback.

### Improved

- **Preflight hardening**: 8 gaps addressed:
  - CRITICAL: GPU nvidia-container-toolkit install now gated behind `--apply-fixes` (previously ran `apt-get install` + `systemctl restart docker` unconditionally, killing running containers on re-run)
  - Docker Buildx missing now detected as `log_fail` with auto-fix command (was silently skipped — root cause of "Docker Compose requires buildx plugin" errors)
  - Buildx version regex uses portable `grep -oE` instead of GNU-only `grep -oP`
  - Port checks expanded: 3003 (Admin UI), 8090 (AudioSocket), 15000 (Health), 18080 (ExternalMedia RTP)
  - System resource checks: RAM (4GB fail / 8GB warn), disk space (10GB warning on models mount)
  - Network connectivity check for huggingface.co before model downloads
  - `HOST_PROJECT_ROOT` validated and auto-seeded in `.env` for Admin UI container management
  - GPU passthrough test cached for 60 minutes via marker file (skips ~200MB CUDA image pull on re-run)
- **Reduced jitter buffer warmup**: `streaming.min_start_ms` from 120ms to 60ms for faster first audio across all providers.
- **Reduced Whisper STT buffer**: 1s to 500ms for faster transcript delivery with Whisper backends.
- **Whisper echo-guard multi-chunk support**: `_arm_whisper_stt_suppression()` stacks chunk durations for streaming responses instead of resetting per-chunk. Barge-in clears suppression immediately via `_clear_whisper_stt_suppression`.
- **Semantic front-loading prompt**: Streaming pipeline appends instruction to begin responses with a brief acknowledgment clause, ensuring the first TTS chunk is meaningful.
- **TTS cache key includes voice/speaker params**: Prevents serving stale audio after voice configuration changes. Cache cleared on `reload_models()`.
- **Whisper first-run model download exceeds startup polling timeout (#299)**: The wizard's server-readiness polling loop used a hardcoded 2-minute timeout for all non-build starts. First-run HuggingFace model downloads (e.g. `distil-large-v3`, `turbo`, `large-v3`) take 3+ minutes on typical connections, causing a false "Polling timed out" error even though the server came up successfully. Directly related to the #297 fix — correcting the turbo model path now causes the download to actually proceed, making this timeout reliably hit. Fix: backend `/api/wizard/local/server-logs` now detects HuggingFace download activity in container logs and returns a `downloading: true` flag; frontend polling loop bumps its ceiling from 2 minutes to 10 minutes on first detection and shows a "⬇️ Downloading model from HuggingFace, please wait…" status message.
- **Sherpa offline transducer crash on startup (#296)**: Wizard never wrote `SHERPA_MODEL_TYPE` to `.env`, so offline transducer models were loaded by the online (streaming) recognizer (`SherpaONNXSTTBackend`). The online recognizer calls `OnlineRecognizer.from_transducer()` against offline model files that lack the `encoder_dims` metadata field, causing an immediate crash and Docker restart loop. Fix: added `model_type` field (`"online"` / `"offline"`) to all `SHERPA_STT_MODELS` catalog entries and updated both wizard code paths (`download_selected_models` and `save_setup_config`) to emit `SHERPA_MODEL_TYPE` alongside `SHERPA_MODEL_PATH`.
- **Whisper Large v3 Turbo STT model init failure (#297)**: `FASTER_WHISPER_STT_MODELS` listed `model_path: "large-v3-turbo"` but `faster-whisper` 1.0.3 (our pinned version) does not recognize `"turbo"` or `"large-v3-turbo"` as valid model size shorthands — turbo support was only added in `faster-whisper` 1.1.0. Fix: changed `model_path` to the HuggingFace repo ID `"deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2"`, which `faster-whisper` 1.0.3 accepts directly (any `owner/repo` string bypasses the model size enum and downloads via `snapshot_download`). Also added `download_root` to persist downloaded models under the bind-mounted volume (`/app/models/stt/faster_whisper_cache`) so they survive container rebuilds.
- **AI briefing always falls back to Basic TTS on non-English deployments (#292)**: Two root causes identified from debug logs. (1) The Local AI Server was running in `LOCAL_AI_MODE=minimal`, causing the LLM handler to return a hardcoded fallback string (`"I'm here to help you. How can I assist you today?"`) that the sanitizer correctly rejected as unusable. (2) Even with a working LLM, the briefing prompt contained no language instruction, so English-language summaries were synthesized by non-English TTS voices (e.g. German Piper), producing garbled audio for the receiving agent. Fix: added `ai_briefing_language` config field (`tools.attended_transfer.ai_briefing_language`); when set, the instruction `"Write the briefing in {language}."` is injected into the LLM prompt. Exposed as a new **Briefing Language** text field in the Admin UI AI Briefing section (shown only when `screening_mode == ai_briefing`). Blank = English (existing behaviour unchanged).
- **Upgrade fails with "No such image: local-ai-server:latest" (#293)**: When upgrading across a release that added or changed `local_ai_server/` source files, the CLI update pipeline marked `local_ai_server` for rebuild via auto file-change detection. Two code paths then tried to start it using `--no-build`, failing immediately on deployments that never built the Local AI image. The `run.sh` rollback path compounded the problem by hardcoding `local_ai_server` in compose-changed targets unconditionally. Fix: (1) compose-changed `--no-build` step now restricts targets to currently-running services only; (2) `rebuildServices` list filtered to running services, matching the existing guard on `restartServices`; (3) `run.sh` rollback path queries running services dynamically instead of hardcoding service names.

## [6.4.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- **Attended Transfer Streaming & Screening (#283)**: Advanced attended (warm) transfer system with three screening modes — `basic_tts` (caller ID + context announcement), `ai_briefing` (experimental AI-written conversation summary via Local AI Server LLM), and `caller_recording` (records caller stating name/reason, plays clip to agent). New streaming delivery mode uses ExternalMedia RTP helper to avoid shared storage dependency, with automatic fallback to file playback. Provider-agnostic runtime tool guidance dynamically exposes configured transfer targets and extension inventories to LLM providers. Live Agents UI redesigned with compact flex layout, auto-polling for agent availability, and conditional Admin UI fields for each screening mode. Includes telephony tools surface audit with deprecation plan for legacy paths.
- **Sherpa Offline STT with VAD (#286)**: VAD-gated offline transducer mode for Sherpa-ONNX. Uses Silero VAD model for per-session voice activity detection with configurable thresholds (`SHERPA_VAD_THRESHOLD`, `SHERPA_VAD_MIN_SILENCE_MS`, `SHERPA_VAD_MIN_SPEECH_MS`). Includes preroll padding to avoid clipped utterance prefixes (`SHERPA_OFFLINE_PREROLL_MS`), streaming-vs-offline model auto-detection with validation, and optional debug diagnostics (`SHERPA_OFFLINE_DEBUG_SEGMENTS`). Set `SHERPA_MODEL_TYPE=offline` to enable.
- **T-one STT Backend (#286)**: Native Russian telephony ASR using the T-one streaming CTC pipeline. Supports beam search and greedy decoding with optional kenlm language model. 300ms chunk framing with internal 16→8kHz handling. Requires conditional Docker build: `docker compose build --build-arg INCLUDE_TONE=true`. Contributed by [@octo-patch](https://github.com/octo-patch).
- **Silero TTS Backend (#286)**: Multi-language text-to-speech with native 8kHz telephony output (no resampling needed). Supports 6 languages (ru, en, de, es, fr, ua) with multiple speaker voices (xenia, aidar, baya, kseniya, eugene for Russian). Model variants v3_0_ru and v3_1_ru. Requires conditional Docker build: `docker compose build --build-arg INCLUDE_SILERO=true`. Contributed by [@octo-patch](https://github.com/octo-patch).
- **Fullscreen toggle for UI panels (#278, #280)**: New `FullscreenPanel` reusable component with `Maximize2`/`Minimize2` toggle, portal-based fullscreen overlay at `z-40`, ref-counted body scroll lock, and Escape key support. Applied to Live System Topology (Dashboard), Call Statistics grid, and Call History table with pagination.
- **Per-message conversation timestamps (#277, #280)**: All 12 `conversation_history.append()` sites in engine now include `time.time()` epoch seconds via `_ts_msg()` helper. Frontend Call Log UI displays human-readable timestamps with epoch-to-millisecond coercion. Added `_sanitize_for_llm()` to strip non-standard keys before sending to LLM adapters, preventing 400/422 rejections on strict OpenAI-compatible providers.

### Fixed

- **HTTP tool output variable array extraction (#281, #282)**: JSONPath wildcards like `records[*].fields.name` now correctly return arrays instead of empty strings. Extracted duplicated `_extract_path` logic into shared `path_utils.extract_path()` with support for `[*]` wildcards, bare `[0]`/`[*]` on root arrays, hyphenated field names (e.g. `line-items[*].sku`), and explicit null-vs-missing semantics. Array/dict results are now JSON-serialized via `json.dumps` instead of Python `str()`. Added `"data"` to sanitizer `keep_keys` so extracted variables reach OpenAI/Deepgram providers, with progressive byte-cap enforcement (drop `result` → `data` → binary-search trim `message`). Fixed `_build_result_message` dropping falsy scalars (`0`, `False`).
- **Silero TTS initialization (#286)**: Fixed torch.hub trust prompt blocking startup, synthetic dropdown value leaking into model path, status path mismatch with dropdown format, and hot-switch backend allowlist.
- **Sherpa offline VAD use-after-free (#286)**: Fixed crash where VAD segment samples were referenced after `vad.pop()` freed the buffer — now copies samples before pop.
- **T-one server numpy import (#286)**: Fixed numpy import compatibility in T-one backend initialization.
- **Trivy CI action**: Updated `aquasecurity/trivy-action` from non-existent `0.33.1` tag to `0.35.0`.

### Improved

- **Attended transfer tool descriptions**: Refreshed tool catalog transfer descriptions for clarity. Extension status checks restricted to configured targets for safety. Explicit target support added to live agent transfer.
- **Admin UI Live Agents**: Compact layout with actions moved to first row. Dynamic auto-polling for agent availability. Conditional display of hangup expert settings when disabled. Fixed in-call HTTP tool discovery.
- **Docker conditional builds**: New `INCLUDE_TONE` and `INCLUDE_SILERO` build args for optional backend inclusion without bloating default image size. Silero models pinned to v5.5 tag for reproducible builds.
- **Sherpa offline tuning knobs**: Documented optimal VAD parameters for telephony use cases in `docs/LOCAL_ONLY_SETUP.md`.

## [6.3.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Microsoft Azure Speech Service STT & TTS**: Full modular pipeline support with three adapters — `AzureSTTFastAdapter` (REST batch transcription), `AzureSTTRealtimeAdapter` (WebSocket streaming with VAD), and `AzureTTSAdapter` (SSML synthesis with streaming and non-streaming modes). Includes Admin UI forms, quick-add templates, security key injection, A-law/μ-law passthrough, and validated config in `ai-agent.yaml`. Contributed by [@egorky](https://github.com/egorky).
- **MiniMax LLM Pipeline Adapter**: New LLM provider supporting MiniMax M2.7 models (latest flagship with enhanced reasoning and coding) via OpenAI-compatible API. Includes tool-calling support, Admin UI integration, and full test suite. Contributed by [@octo-patch](https://github.com/octo-patch).
- **Call Recording Playback**: Play back Asterisk/FreePBX call recordings directly from the Call Details modal in the Admin UI. Recordings are auto-matched by channel unique ID from the monitor directory (`YYYY/MM/DD/` layout). Includes play/pause controls, seek bar, time display, filename, and file size. Empty WAV files (header-only) are shown as "no audio captured". Configurable via `ASTERISK_RECORDING_PATH` env var.
- **Google Calendar delete()**: Full delete event implementation with timezone handling fixes and code quality improvements. Contributed by [@gcsuri](https://github.com/gcsuri).

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Realtime farewell timeout**: Cancel farewell timeout before emitting HangupReady to prevent race condition on call termination.
- **Greeting protection duration**: Increased to 5000ms for more reliable greeting playback on slower connections.
- **Local AI setup wizard**: Show "Setting Up Local AI Server" until server is actually ready; improved build log filtering for progress tracking.
- **NVIDIA GPU setup**: Auto-install nvidia-container-toolkit and improved wizard progress tracking.

### Security

- **Azure SSRF prevention**: Shared `validate_azure_region()` regex validator applied across Pydantic config models, runtime URL builders, and admin API endpoint.
- **PII logging discipline**: Removed transcript/text preview strings from all log statements across engine, Azure, and OpenAI adapters — logs now contain metadata only (length, role, flags).
- **Azure key injection**: Type-based detection (`cfg_type == "azure"`) for custom-named Azure providers, not just name-prefix matching.
- **Input validation hardening**: LLM aggregation thresholds clamped with try/except and min=1 guards in both Python backend and React frontend.

### Improved

- **Azure STT bounded pre-speech buffer**: Audio buffer only accumulates when speech is detected or speaking is active, preventing unbounded memory growth during long silences.
- **Azure VAD timeout propagation**: `vad_silence_timeout_ms` and `vad_initial_silence_timeout_ms` now properly passed through `_compose_options`.
- **Azure variant validation**: Constrained to `Literal["realtime", "fast"]` across config model, orchestrator, and Admin UI (select dropdown instead of free text).
- **PEP 563 deferred annotations**: `from __future__ import annotations` in azure.py enables safe optional-dependency type hints when aiohttp is not installed.

## [6.3.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **CLI verification tooling**: `agent check --local/--remote` for Local AI Server + Asterisk/Admin UI validation; `agent rca --local` for automated local test report generation and Community Test Matrix submissions.
- **Community Test Matrix**: Added `docs/COMMUNITY_TEST_MATRIX.md` and a GitHub issue template for standardized local AI test result reporting.
- **Admin UI backend enable/rebuild flow**: One-click backend enable with progress tracking for optional Local AI Server backends (e.g., Faster-Whisper, Whisper.cpp, MeloTTS).
- **Local AI Server WS protocol contract**: JSON-schema-based protocol contract + smoke test utilities to stabilize client/server evolution.

### Improved

- **CPU-first onboarding**: Local AI Server defaults to `runtime_mode=minimal` when preflight reports no GPU (`GPU_AVAILABLE=false`) so CPU-only systems start reliably without LLM model files.
- **GPU ergonomics**: GPU layer auto-detection for `LOCAL_LLM_GPU_LAYERS=-1`, preflight warnings for GPU-detected-but-CPU-configured LLM runs, and GPU compose overlay improvements for out-of-the-box backend switching.
- **Model lifecycle UX**: Expanded model catalog metadata, clearer rebuild requirements, and improved model switching + status reflection (including Kroko embedded inference and Kokoro settings alignment).

### Fixed

- **Local provider audio + barge-in stability**: Robust barge-in protocol handling, improved gating to avoid STT/TTS talk-loops, and stabilized timing/latency tracking for local calls.
- **Tool-call parsing robustness**: Hardened local tool-call extraction against malformed wrappers/markdown/control-token leaks; improved clean-text extraction to prevent tool syntax from reaching TTS.
- **Hangup correctness**: Added/strengthened hangup guardrails for local LLMs to prevent hallucinated end-call tool executions; improved farewell handling to avoid spoken tool chatter.
- **MeloTTS reliability**: Fixed build/runtime pinning, warmup behavior, and upstream install regressions to restore stable container rebuilds.
- **AAVA-200 — Cosmetic UI bug at end of local full setup**: Fixed "No such container" error displayed at completion of the local AI setup wizard flow.
- **AAVA-199 — Transfer tool enabling error on fresh install**: Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null` when enabling the transfer tool on a fresh installation.
- **AAVA-193 — Setup Wizard local_ai_server start/logs fails**: Fixed compose execution context issue where the wizard's start and log-streaming commands failed due to incorrect working directory.
- **AAVA-195 — Kroko embedded selection when binary unavailable**: Admin UI now gates Kroko embedded mode behind capability detection across Wizard, Env page, and model selectors; added rebuild hints for all optional backends (Faster-Whisper, Whisper.cpp, MeloTTS) and added missing Whisper.cpp backend to Env page STT dropdown.

### Refactored

- **Local AI Server internals**: Consolidated and hardened model loading, status reporting, and model switching paths with degraded-start behavior and operator-visible fallbacks.

### Guardrails

- **Structured local tool gateway**: Allowlist-driven tool execution path with repair/structured-decision fallbacks; explicit blocking of unsafe terminal tools without user intent (especially `hangup_call`).

### Performance

- **LLM startup tuning**: Improved default context sizing on GPU, optional auto-context selection/caching, and startup warmup/latency instrumentation for operator visibility.

### Security

- **Concurrent rebuild race condition**: Fixed TOCTOU race on `_active_rebuild` flag — atomic check-and-set under lock prevents duplicate Docker builds.
- **Safe archive extraction**: Zip and tar `extractall` calls now pass validated member lists to prevent path traversal via crafted archives (zip-slip).
- **GGUF magic-byte validation**: Downloaded `.gguf` model files are validated for the `GGUF` magic header before being accepted; corrupt or non-GGUF files are cleaned up automatically.
- **Active-call guard on model switch**: `/api/local-ai/switch` blocks model switches while AI Engine reports active calls (override via `force_incompatible_apply`); unreachable engine treated as blocked.
- **Path traversal hardening**: All model download paths, voice file names, and custom LLM model paths are sanitized via `_safe_filename` and `_safe_join_under_dir` helpers; strict filename validation rejects directory traversal patterns.

### Docs

- **Local AI onboarding docs refresh**: Updated installation + local-only setup guides, hardware requirements, local profiles, and CLI tools guide; added archived GPU learnings + audit report for GA readiness tracking.

## [6.2.2] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Vertex AI Credentials Not Found**: Auto-inject `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env var when the service account JSON file exists at the default mount path (`/app/project/secrets/gcp-service-account.json`). Handles 3 cases: env var unset, env var pointing to missing file (override), and stale pointer with no fallback (unset to prevent ADC crash).
- **Vertex AI ADC Graceful Fallback**: When `use_vertex_ai: true` but ADC fails (e.g. no service account uploaded), the Google Live provider now falls back to Developer API (api_key) mode instead of crashing the call with `DefaultCredentialsError`. Consistent `_vertex_active` instance flag ensures model path, tool responses, and connection URL all use the correct API format after fallback.
- **Secrets Directory Permissions**: `setup_secrets_directory()` in `install.sh` now always fixes ownership to UID 1000 (appuser) with mode 2770, not just on creation. Fixes "Permission denied" when uploading Vertex AI credentials via Admin UI (backend runs as appuser via gosu).
- **False "Apply Changes" for local_ai_server** (AAVA-192 related): Environment page no longer shows restart prompts for containers that aren't running — prevents confusing drift detection when `local_ai_server` is intentionally stopped.
- **AAVA-192 — install.sh Duplicate YAML Keys**: Fallback path in `update_yaml_llm()` no longer blindly appends a duplicate `llm:` block. Uses Python/PyYAML or sed-based in-place update when the block already exists.
- **AAVA-185 — Dashboard Pipeline Variant Display**: Wizard now sets `active_pipeline` and `default_provider` to the variant-specific name (e.g. `local_hybrid_groq`) when Groq LLM is selected. Dashboard topology adds defensive variant matching for backward compatibility.

### Added

- **Secrets Directory in install.sh**: `setup_secrets_directory()` creates `./secrets/` with correct permissions (2770) during installation, aligning with `preflight.sh`.
- **COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME Auto-set**: `install.sh` now ensures `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=asterisk-ai-voice-agent` is set in `.env` for consistency with `preflight.sh`.
- **Auto-upsert GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS on Upload**: When Vertex AI credentials are uploaded via Admin UI, the env var is automatically added to `.env` for persistence across container recreates.

### Migration from v6.2.1

1. **No breaking changes.** All fixes are backward compatible.
2. **Vertex AI users**: Credentials will be auto-detected on next container restart — no manual `.env` editing needed.
3. **Docker rebuild required**: Run `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` to pick up all fixes.

## [6.2.1] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Google Vertex AI Live API Support**: Enterprise-grade authentication for Google Live API using GCP service accounts. Switch between Developer API (API key) and Vertex AI (OAuth2) modes via Admin UI toggle. Includes credential upload/verify/delete endpoints, environment injection, and preflight secrets directory validation ([PR #235](https://github.com/hkjarral/Asterisk-AI-Voice-Agent/pull/235)).
- **Admin UI Vertex AI Configuration**: New Vertex AI section in Google Live provider settings with project/location selectors, credential upload widget, and real-time verification status.
- **Preflight Secrets Directory Check**: `preflight.sh` now validates and auto-creates `./secrets/` with correct ownership and permissions (2770) for service account JSON files.
- **Golden Baseline Config**: `config/ai-agent.golden-google-live.yaml` updated with Vertex AI configuration examples.

### Changed

- **Google Live Provider**: Dual-mode endpoint construction — Vertex AI uses `{location}-aiplatform.googleapis.com` with OAuth2 bearer tokens; Developer API unchanged.
- **Tool Response Format**: Removed `id` field from `functionResponses` when using Vertex AI (not supported by Vertex API).

### Fixed

- **Async Blocking Call**: `credentials.refresh()` now runs in thread pool to avoid blocking asyncio event loop.
- **Exception Leaking**: Vertex AI endpoints no longer expose internal error details to clients.
- **Null Filename Check**: `upload_vertex_credentials` validates `file.filename` before use.

### Documentation

- Milestone 25: Google Vertex AI Live API Support (`docs/contributing/milestones/milestone-25-google-vertex.md`)

### Migration from v6.2.0

1. **No breaking changes.** Vertex AI is opt-in; existing API key mode works unchanged.
2. **Vertex AI users**: Upload service account JSON via Admin UI → Google Live → Vertex AI Configuration.
3. **Docker rebuild required**: Run `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` for secrets volume mount.

## [6.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **NumPy Audio Resampler**: Replaced legacy `audioop.ratecv` with NumPy linear interpolation at all 19 call sites, eliminating audio crackling artifacts. Community contribution by [@turgutguvercin](https://github.com/turgutguvercin) ([PR #204](https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk/pull/204)).
- **Google Native Audio Latest Model**: Support for `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-latest` — Google's audio-native model with true audio understanding, tuned defaults for telephony use cases.
- **Google Live VAD Tuning**: `realtimeInputConfig` support for short utterance detection; configurable via Admin UI advanced settings.
- **Google Live Keepalive Expert Knobs**: Smoother config updates and WebSocket keepalive tuning for long-running sessions.
- **Google Live Input Gain Normalization**: Provider-level input gain for consistent audio levels across telephony trunks.
- **Admin UI Tool Catalog**: Read-only page listing all available built-in and MCP tools with descriptions and parameter schemas (PR #211).
- **Admin UI Google Live Settings**: VAD tuning and hangup fallback tooltips exposed as advanced provider settings.
- **Agent CLI `check --fix`**: Auto-repair common configuration issues with minimal production baseline config for recovery; hardened restore logic (PR #210).
- **Telnyx AI Inference LLM**: New modular pipeline provider `telnyx_llm` using OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions via Telnyx AI Inference. Access 53+ models (GPT-4o, Claude, Llama, Mistral) with a single `TELNYX_API_KEY`. Includes golden baseline config, Admin UI provider form, and setup guide. Community contribution by Abhishek @ Telnyx ([PR #219](https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk/pull/219)).
- **Preflight `--force`**: Bypass unsupported OS check for exotic distributions.

### Changed

- **Google Live Farewell Handling**: Settled on farewell-play-out design (removed experimental auto-reconnect on 1008 disconnect); neutralized tool response to prevent duplicate farewells.
- **Google Live TTS Gating**: Per-segment re-arm so silence replaces echo on every turn; enabled on AudioSocket transport.
- **Call Ending Prompts**: Tightened prompts to prevent verbal farewell before `hangup_call` tool invocation across all providers.
- **Transparent Model Name Flow**: Removed silent fallback/remapping for Google Live model names; aligned names across UI and wizard.
- **Demo Contexts Restored**: All 11 demo contexts from v6.0.0 baseline restored.

### Fixed

- **Audio Crackling**: NumPy resampler fixes crackling caused by `audioop.ratecv` discontinuities ([PR #204](https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk/pull/204), [@turgutguvercin](https://github.com/turgutguvercin)).
- **Call Termination Hardening**: 13 fixes across providers, engine, and AudioSocket for reliable call endings and proper cleanup.
- **Google Live Duplicate Farewell**: 6+ iterations eliminating race conditions between tool-ack `turnComplete`, forced farewell, and model post-hangup speech.
- **Google Live Premature Hangup**: Fixed hangup firing on tool-acknowledgment `turnComplete` before farewell audio finishes playing.
- **Google Live Model Names**: Transparent model name flow — removed silent fallback/remapping; aligned names across UI and wizard.
- **Pipeline Call History**: Tool calls now recorded in session so they appear in Admin UI Call History.
- **Provider Topology Accuracy**: Clear stale `provider_name` on pipeline calls so UI topology is accurate.
- **Agent CLI Conflict Markers**: Reduced conflict-marker false positives in `agent check`.
- **Agent CLI Wizard Logger**: Removed invalid logger kwargs.
- **Agent CLI Restore Safety**: Hardened `check --fix` restore to avoid partial writes.
- **Admin UI Tool Catalog**: Removed unreachable except in tool catalog (PR #212).

### Security

- **CodeQL SSRF Fix**: Google API key now passed as params instead of URL path to prevent SSRF (CodeQL alert).

### Documentation

- Telnyx AI Inference Provider Setup Guide (`docs/Provider-Telnyx-Setup.md`)
- Milestones 23 (NAT) and 24 (Phase Tools) added to milestone history
- Complete documentation, roadmap, and community alignment overhaul
- Roadmap and Milestone History links added to main README hero nav bar

### Migration from v6.1.1

1. **No breaking changes.** All new features are additive or opt-in.
2. Existing `config/ai-agent.yaml` continues to work unchanged.
3. **Docker rebuild required**: Run `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` for all containers.
4. **Telnyx users**: Add `TELNYX_API_KEY` to `.env` and configure `telnyx_hybrid` pipeline. See `docs/Provider-Telnyx-Setup.md`.
5. **Google Live users**: Default model updated to `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-latest`. No action needed unless you pinned a specific model.

## [6.1.1] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Operator Config Override (`ai-agent.local.yaml`)**: Operator customizations are now stored in `config/ai-agent.local.yaml` (git-ignored), deep-merged on top of the base `config/ai-agent.yaml` at startup. All Admin UI saves, CLI wizard writes, and `agent setup` output target the local file, so upstream `git pull` never conflicts with operator config. Local overrides can delete base keys by setting them to `null`.
- **Graceful Stash Pop Recovery**: `agent update` now automatically recovers from `git stash pop` merge conflicts by resetting the working tree, dropping the failed stash, and restoring operator config (`.env`, `ai-agent.yaml`, `ai-agent.local.yaml`, `users.json`, `contexts/`) from the pre-update backup.
- **Live Agent Transfer Tool**: Explicit `live_agent_transfer` tool with ARI-based extension status checks, auto-derived internal extension keys, and fallback routing to configured live-agent destinations.
- **ARI Extension Status API**: Admin UI endpoint to query Asterisk device/endpoint state for live agent availability before transferring.
- **ViciDial Outbound Dialer Compatibility**: Configurable `AAVA_OUTBOUND_DIAL_CONTEXT`, `AAVA_OUTBOUND_DIAL_PREFIX`, `AAVA_OUTBOUND_CHANNEL_TECH`, and `AAVA_OUTBOUND_PBX_TYPE` (`freepbx`/`vicidial`/`generic`) for outbound campaign origination.
- **GPU Host/Runtime Indicators**: Runtime GPU probe details in local AI server status with CUDA guard for STT/TTS backend selection and CPU fallback when GPU is unavailable.
- **GPU-Aware Compatibility Checks**: Force rebuild flow for incompatible runtime/device combinations with `force_incompatible_apply` flag for intentional overrides.
- **Local-Hybrid Wizard Persistence**: Setup wizard correctly persists `local_hybrid` pipeline, local STT/TTS backend selections, and model mappings through env and YAML config.
- **Asterisk Config Discovery (Admin UI)**: New **System → Asterisk** page with live ARI connection status, required module checklist, configuration audit from preflight, and guided fix snippets. Dashboard pill shows Asterisk connection state (green/red) with click-through. Supports both local and remote Asterisk deployments.
- **Preflight Asterisk Config Audit**: `preflight.sh` now audits `ari.conf`, `http.conf`, `extensions_custom.conf`, and 4 key Asterisk modules (`app_audiosocket`, `res_ari`, `res_stasis`, `chan_pjsip`), writing results to `data/asterisk_status.json` for the Admin UI.

### Changed

- **Tool Name Canonicalization**: `transfer` is now an alias for `blind_transfer`. `live_agent` and `transfer_to_live_agent` are aliases for `live_agent_transfer`. Tool allowlisting uses `canonicalize_tool_name()` for alias-aware matching across contexts.
- **Admin UI Live Agent Section**: Status pills with real-time ARI checks, rebalanced row columns, destination override hidden behind Advanced toggle, internal extensions labeled as live agents.
- **Admin UI Docker Compose GPU Overlay**: `start`/`recreate`/`rebuild` actions for `local_ai_server` now include `docker-compose.gpu.yml` when `GPU_AVAILABLE=true`.

### Fixed

- **`blind_transfer` Destination Resolution**: Fixed numeric target resolution and cross-provider naming (`transfer` vs `blind_transfer`) in tool allowlists.
- **`live_agent_transfer` Fallback Routing**: Prevents mapping to non-live-agent destinations; falls back to explicit live-agent config or internal extensions.
- **Streaming `provider_grace_ms` Cap**: Reverted then re-fixed the 60ms hardcoded cap on `provider_grace_ms` that degraded streaming latency.
- **`check_extension_status` Opt-In**: Made the extension status tool opt-in; removed hardcoded transfer key examples from tool registry.
- **Admin UI Log Troubleshooting**: Exclude per-frame audio noise from log views; add milestone tracking markers.
- **Admin UI System API Indentation**: Fixed YAML indentation in system config API responses.
- **Environment Drift Detection**: Ignore compose-injected `HEALTH_BIND_HOST` (only track `HEALTH_CHECK_*` prefix) to prevent perpetual "pending restart" drift in Env UI.
- **Docker Image Metadata**: Handle missing Docker image metadata in containers API (`ImageNotFound` after prune/rebuild) without failing the endpoint.
- **GPU Compose Overlay Preservation**: Preserve GPU compose overlay for `local_ai_server` UI actions (start, recreate, rebuild) so GPU device requests are not silently dropped.
- **EnvPage GPU-Aware CUDA Options**: CUDA device option for Faster-Whisper and MeloTTS only shown when `GPU_AVAILABLE=true`.

### Documentation

- ViciDial Integration Guide (`docs/Vicidial-Setup.md`)
- Fixed `transfer_call` references to canonical `transfer` / `blind_transfer` in ElevenLabs milestone docs
- Updated 9 docs for `ai-agent.local.yaml` config override system and stash pop recovery procedures

### Migration from v6.0.0

1. **No breaking changes.** All new features are additive or opt-in.
2. Existing `config/ai-agent.yaml` continues to work unchanged. The new `ai-agent.local.yaml` is optional.
3. **Docker rebuild required**: Run `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` for all containers.
4. **ViciDial users**: Set `AAVA_OUTBOUND_PBX_TYPE=vicidial` in `.env` and configure dial context/prefix as needed.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-02-07

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **OpenAI Realtime API version default changed to GA**: The default `api_version` is now `ga` (was `beta`). GA uses a nested audio schema (`audio.input.format` / `audio.output.format` with MIME types) instead of flat fields. Set `api_version: beta` explicitly to keep the old behavior.
- **Email template autoescaping enabled**: `template_renderer.py` now uses `autoescape=True` by default. Custom HTML templates that rely on unescaped variable output may need to use Jinja2's `| safe` filter for intentionally raw HTML variables.

### Added

- **OpenAI Realtime GA API Support**: Full Beta-to-GA migration with `api_version` toggle (`ga` / `beta`). GA mode uses nested `audio.input.format` / `audio.output.format` with MIME types (`audio/pcm`, `audio/pcmu`, `audio/pcma`), `turn_detection` under `audio.input`, and `output_modalities` instead of `modalities`. Production-validated with `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17`.
- **OpenAI Realtime `project_id`**: New config field and UI input for OpenAI project tracking via the `OpenAI-Project` header.
- **OpenAI Realtime Voice Expansion**: 10 voices with gender labels (alloy, ash, ballad, cedar, coral, echo, marin, sage, shimmer, verse). Removed unsupported voices (nova, fable, onyx).
- **Email System Overhaul**: New SMTP client (`smtp_client.py`) with rate limiting and deduplication, email dispatcher with provider abstraction (Resend / SMTP / auto-detect), HTML template engine with Jinja2 sandboxed rendering, per-context `from_email` / `admin_email` overrides, subject prefix, `call_outcome` and `hangup_initiator` template variables.
- **Email Template Editor**: Admin UI modal for editing HTML email templates with defaults, preview, and per-tool configuration.
- **SMTP Test Email**: Admin UI button to send a test email using current SMTP settings before saving.
- **Google Live Hangup Fallback Watchdog**: Tunable timeout-based fallback for calls where Google Live does not emit `turnComplete`. Four new config fields: `hangup_fallback_audio_idle_sec`, `hangup_fallback_min_armed_sec`, `hangup_fallback_no_audio_timeout_sec`, `hangup_fallback_turn_complete_timeout_sec`.
- **Google Live `toolConfig`**: Explicit tool configuration in setup message; fixed empty `required` arrays that caused 1008 disconnects.
- **NAT / Advertise Host (Milestone 23)**: `AUDIOSOCKET_ADVERTISE_HOST` and `EXTERNAL_MEDIA_ADVERTISE_HOST` environment variables for split-horizon / NAT deployments where the advertised address differs from the bind address.
- **GPU Acceleration Path**: `docker-compose.gpu.yml` overlay, `Dockerfile.gpu` with CUDA wheel build for llama-cpp-python, preflight GPU detection (`GPU_AVAILABLE` env var), and gated GPU layer configuration.
- **Dashboard Live System Topology**: Clickable topology nodes navigate to settings pages (Providers → `/providers`, Pipelines → `/pipelines`, Models → `/models`, Asterisk/AI Engine → `/env`). Active model cards, pipeline path highlighting, platform info bar, compact resource strip.
- **Admin UI Modernization**: Modern confirm dialogs (replaced all `alert()` / `confirm()`), toast notifications, `AlertDialog` component, SVG T-junction arrows, hover transitions, loading spinners.
- **EnvPage Refactor**: Tab-based UI (AI Engine / Local AI / System) with comprehensive variable coverage, Docker Build Settings section for `INCLUDE_*` build-time flags.
- **Help Section**: In-app documentation viewer with terminal-style rendering.
- **Models Page Redesign**: Stacked full-width layout with active model cards showing real-time usage during calls.
- **Env Drift Detection**: "Apply Changes" now detects `.env` drift vs running containers and recomputes the apply plan. SMTP/Resend env changes correctly trigger `ai_engine` restart.

### Changed

- **Hangup Tool Simplified (v5.0 design)**: Removed transcript-offer guardrails from `hangup_call` tool. The AI now manages transcript offers via system prompt instead of tool-level blocking. Simpler, fewer race conditions.
- **UI `downstream_mode` options**: Replaced invalid `burst` option with valid `file` option to match backend schema.
- **UI `response_modalities` serialization**: Now serializes as `List[str]` (e.g., `["audio"]`) instead of a comma-separated string.

### Fixed

- **Google Live Hangup Before `turnComplete`**: Fixed race where hangup could fire before the provider emitted `turnComplete`, causing stuck calls.
- **Google Live Model Normalization**: Hardened model name normalization and provider options to prevent 1008 errors from malformed setup messages.
- **OpenAI Realtime GA Schema Stabilization**: 15+ iterative fixes for GA session.update format — MIME types, nested format objects, rate fields, turn_detection placement, delta type handling, output format enforcement.
- **OpenAI Realtime GA `response.create`**: Removed `output_modalities` and `input` array from GA response.create (rejected by API).
- **OpenAI Realtime GA `delta` Handling**: Fixed crash where `response.output_audio.delta` sends `delta` as a base64 string, not a dict.
- **Email Template Save**: Fixed template persistence and `call_outcome` variable availability.
- **Request Transcript Email**: Fixed issue where `request_transcript` used the last email address instead of the one from the current request.
- **UI No-Op Knobs Removed**: Removed `create_response` checkbox from OpenAI Realtime form (GA hardcodes `true`), removed `continuous_input` checkbox from Google Live form (no backend field).
- **Test Alignment**: OpenAI Realtime provider test updated for GA payload shape; hangup tool tests aligned with v5.0 simplified design.

### Security

- **Email Template Autoescaping**: `SandboxedEnvironment(autoescape=True)` prevents HTML injection from user-controlled template variables (e.g., caller speech transcripts). Pre-escaped keys (`transcript_html`, `transcript`) use `Markup()` to avoid double-escaping.

### Migration from v5.3.1

1. **OpenAI Realtime users**: If you were using the default `api_version` (previously `beta`), the new default is `ga`. To keep beta behavior, explicitly set `providers.openai_realtime.api_version: beta` in your YAML config.
2. **Email users**: SMTP support is new. Existing Resend-only setups continue to work unchanged. To use SMTP, add `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` to your `.env`.
3. **Docker rebuild required**: Run `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` for all containers.
4. **Run preflight**: Execute `./preflight.sh` to detect GPU availability and validate system state.

## [5.3.1] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Deepgram Language Configuration**: Voice Agent language is now configurable via Admin UI and YAML (`agent_language` field). Supports 30+ languages including English variants, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, and more.
- **Phase Tools (Milestone 24)**: Pre-call HTTP lookups (enrichment), in-call HTTP tools (AI-invoked during conversation), and post-call webhooks (fire-and-forget automation).
- **HTTP Tool Debug Trace Logs**: When `LOG_LEVEL=debug`, pre/in/post-call HTTP tools emit `[HTTP_TOOL_TRACE]` logs showing the resolved request (URL/headers/body), referenced variables, and a bounded response preview to speed up troubleshooting.
- **Extension Availability Tool (AAVA-53)**: New `check_extension_status` tool to query Asterisk device state (e.g., `PJSIP/2765`) so the AI can decide whether to transfer or continue.
- **Hangup Policy Controls**: `hangup_call` now supports a configurable policy (markers and guardrails) via `tools.hangup_call.policy`.
- **Admin UI YAML Error Recovery**: YAML parse errors now show a banner with line/column and the Raw YAML page can still load content for quick fixes.
- **Agent CLI RCA Enhancements**: `agent rca [call_id]` support, optional `--llm` forcing, and tool call extraction to improve post-call debugging.

### Fixed

- **RTP Greeting Cutoff on External Trunk Calls**: Fixed issue where greeting audio was cut off on calls from external trunks. Root cause: Asterisk ExternalMedia requires audio to flow through the mixing bridge before it sends RTP. Added "RTP kick" that plays brief silence through the bridge immediately after ExternalMedia setup, triggering RTP flow in ~40-50ms instead of waiting 5-7 seconds for caller audio.
- **Admin UI Setup Wizard (AAVA-164)**: ElevenLabs Agent ID field now auto-populates from `.env` file when re-running the wizard.
- **Admin UI Log Export (AAVA-162)**: Exported debug logs now redact email addresses (`[EMAIL_REDACTED]`) to protect user privacy.
- **Admin UI Environment Changes (AAVA-161)**: "Apply Changes" after modifying `.env` variables now uses `docker compose --force-recreate` instead of container restart, ensuring environment variable changes are actually applied (e.g., `LOG_TO_FILE`, `LOG_FILE_PATH`).
- **In-Call HTTP Tools Config Wiring**: Align tool schema across engine/Admin UI/docs and support context allowlisting of in-call HTTP tools.
- **Admin UI Variable Usability Hint**: HTTP tool editors now highlight variable names that can be referenced elsewhere (e.g., `{patient_id}`), reducing confusion with JSON extraction paths (e.g., `patient.id`).
- **Google Live Transcription Stability**: Reduce duplicate transcript fragments and improve output PCM rate detection from provider mimeType.

### Security

- Admin UI HTTP tool **Test** now blocks localhost/private targets by default (SSRF mitigation); can be overridden for trusted networks via environment variables.

## [5.2.5] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- Updates: publish the `asterisk-ai-voice-agent-updater` image to GHCR on release tags (aligned with other containers).
- Admin UI: Stable/Main/Advanced update targets + render the latest release notes (from `CHANGELOG.md`) after **Check updates**.
- Agent CLI: `agent update` supports semver tag refs like `v5.2.5` (in addition to branches).

### Changed

- Config: fresh installs now default to **AudioSocket** (`audio_transport: audiosocket`).

### Fixed

- Admin UI Updates: prefer pulling the published updater image and fall back to a local build using host networking in restricted DNS/egress environments.

## [5.2.4] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Admin UI: Dashboard no longer performs update checks that can trigger building the updater image; updates are checked only from **System → Updates** on explicit user action.
- Admin UI: Docker Services “Restart” uses Docker SDK restart (avoids compose recreate failures on hosts where repo paths like `/root/...` are not accessible inside the `admin_ui` container).
- Admin UI: compose-based start/recreate/build operations are executed via the detached updater runner to ensure host-path resolution is correct.

## [5.2.3] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Agent CLI: `agent update` no longer runs an unscoped `docker compose up` when Compose files change; it targets only running/impacted services to avoid unintentionally creating optional services (e.g., `local_ai_server`) and failing on systems that never built those images.

## [5.2.2] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Agent CLI: `agent update` now fetches branches using an explicit refspec so `origin/<ref>` is reliably updated (prevents false “Already up to date” results when the remote-tracking branch is stale).

## [5.2.1] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- Admin UI: **System → Updates** page with a GitHub-style flow: **Check updates → choose branch → preview file/container impact → proceed**.
- Admin UI: branch dropdown supports updating to **any remote branch** (useful for testing feature/fix branches via UI).
- Admin UI: **Recent Runs** table (last 10) with job summaries (success/failure, rebuild/restart actions, file count) and recovery helpers.
- Admin UI: one-click **Rollback** for failed update jobs (restores pre-update code + operator config from the backup; rebuilds/restarts only impacted services).
- Admin UI: keep full update logs for both success and failure runs.
- Agent CLI: `agent update` enhancements for UI-driven updates:
  - `--plan` / `--plan-json` to preview actions without applying
  - `--checkout` to allow switching branches when updating to a non-current ref
  - `--include-ui` to include/exclude `admin_ui` rebuild/restart
  - `--backup-id` for stable backups (used by UI jobs)
  - UI-driven updates also refresh the project-local CLI binary at `./.agent/bin/agent`

### Changed

- Updates: “latest version” checks consider **`v*` tags only** and compute status using commit ancestry (handles “local ahead” cleanly).
- Updates: UI-triggered jobs write state under `./.agent/updates/jobs/` and backups under `./.agent/update-backups/<job_id>/`.
- Updater: update/plan execution runs in a **detached updater container** so jobs survive `admin_ui` rebuild/restarts.

### Fixed

- Updates: docker compose operations from inside containers now resolve bind mounts correctly by mounting the repo at the **same absolute host path**.
- Updates: respect non-default Docker socket mounts (e.g., `DOCKER_SOCK`) when starting updater jobs.
- Updates: avoid transient “Update job not found” UI errors immediately after starting a job.

## [5.1.7] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- Engine: provider-agnostic **Upstream Squelch** for continuous-audio providers with native VAD (improves end-of-turn detection in noisy environments).
- Admin UI: new **Upstream Squelch** controls and tooltips under Advanced → VAD.
- Streaming (ExternalMedia RTP): add a short, configurable wait for the remote RTP endpoint during the initial greeting before falling back to file playback (reduces “dead air until caller speaks” on some Asterisk setups).

### Changed

- Config: default `farewell_hangup_delay_sec` is now `5` seconds (provider override still wins when set).
- Prompts: updated OpenAI Realtime demo greeting text.

### Fixed

- Admin UI: auto-detect the media directory group inside the container and add `appuser` to that GID at startup, preventing false “media directory not writable” warnings after host reboots on systems where Asterisk uses a non-default group ID.
- Hangup tool: provider-agnostic transcript gating and contact-confirmation guardrails to prevent premature hangups and repeated transcript prompts.
- OpenAI Realtime: avoid cutting off farewell speech by waiting for `output_audio.done` before emitting `HangupReady`.

## [5.1.6] - 2026-01-20

### Added

- Admin UI Dashboard: show current project version in the **System Ready** card (best-effort detection via `git describe` with fallback to README parsing; supports `AAVA_PROJECT_VERSION` override).

### Changed

- Docs/CLI: align operator-facing version references to `v5.1.6` (avoid hardcoded `v5.0` strings in CLI help/output where possible).
- Agent CLI: default `agent version` string now reports `5.1.6` (still overridable via `-ldflags`).

### Fixed

- Admin UI Setup Wizard: OpenAI Realtime now prompts for the OpenAI API key (no Groq key mix-up) and validates correctly.
- Agent CLI `agent rca`: detect AudioSocket vs ExternalMedia calls and tailor transport diagnostics (avoid AudioSocket-only false positives).
- Admin UI System Ready: report **host** Docker Compose version via container labels (`com.docker.compose.version`) with fallback to container CLI detection when labels aren’t available.
- Admin UI Web Terminal: input text is now legible on dark background (light text).
- Docker builds: pin base OS/runtime to avoid upstream tag drift (`admin_ui`/`ai_engine`: Debian 12 `bookworm` + Python 3.11; `local_ai_server`: Debian 13 `trixie` + Python 3.11 for Kroko compatibility).
- Ollama pipelines: prevent overly-eager `hangup_call` tool calls from ending calls when the caller did not indicate end-of-call intent; support `num_ctx` pass-through and honor `tools_enabled` for tool calling.
- Email transcripts: improve Outlook compatibility by rendering transcript newlines as `<br/>` (HTML-escaped) so caller/AI lines display correctly across clients.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed

- **CLI Command Names**: v5.0.0 binaries were built with old command names; this release includes the updated CLI:
  - `agent check` - Standard diagnostics report (renamed from `agent doctor`)
  - `agent rca` - Post-call root cause analysis (renamed from `agent troubleshoot`)
  - `agent setup` - Interactive setup wizard (renamed from `agent init`)
  - Legacy aliases (`doctor`, `troubleshoot`, `init`, `demo`) remain available as hidden commands for backward compatibility

- **Preflight Script - Remote Asterisk Support** (AAVA-150):
  - New `check_data_permissions()` function runs regardless of Asterisk location
  - Fixes `call_history.db` read-only error for users with remote/containerized Asterisk
  - Detects and fixes root-owned database files that container user cannot write to

- **Preflight Script - Symlink Handling** (AAVA-150):
  - Non-empty directories at `/var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ai-generated` now auto-backed up with `--apply-fixes`
  - Fixes the "ai-generated/ai-generated/" double-path issue
  - Prevents silent symlink creation failures

## [5.0.0] - 2026-01-07

### Added

- Outbound Campaign Dialer (**Alpha**) (Admin UI → Call Scheduling):
  - Campaign scheduler (single-node) with pacing + concurrency controls
  - CSV lead import (skip-existing), lead actions (recycle/reset/ignore/delete)
  - Dialplan-assisted voicemail detection via Asterisk `AMD()` and voicemail drop
  - Optional consent gate (DTMF `1` accept / `2` deny / timeout tracking)
  - Recording library (upload once, reuse across campaigns) + shipped default consent/voicemail prompts
- Groq Speech (STT + TTS) adapters for modular pipeline deployments
- Attended (warm) transfer tool with DTMF acceptance flow
- Preflight hardening and operator guidance (cross-platform checks, docker socket guidance, local-ai “minimal vs full” mode)

### Changed

- Standardized Docker Compose service/container names: `admin_ui`, `ai_engine`, `local_ai_server`
- Container base OS alignment:
  - `admin_ui`: Python 3.11 on Debian 12 (`bookworm`)
  - `ai_engine`: Python 3.11 on Debian 12 (`bookworm`)
  - `local_ai_server`: Python 3.11 on Debian 13 (`trixie`) (intentional for embedded Kroko/glibc compatibility)

### Fixed

- Outbound dialer reliability fixes (caller-id inheritance, outcome tracking, SQLite write/lock edge cases, duplicate side-effects)
- Admin UI stability improvements (tooltips, recording preview UX, safer compose/health behaviors)
- Ollama pipeline robustness (provider config resolution + tool-result handling improvements)

### Docs

- Added `docs/OUTBOUND_CALLING.md` and updated FreePBX + installation docs for v5.0.0

## [4.6.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- ARI connectivity enhancements:
  - `ASTERISK_ARI_PORT` support
  - `ASTERISK_ARI_SCHEME` (`http|https`) with `ws://` vs `wss://` alignment
  - `ASTERISK_ARI_SSL_VERIFY` toggle for self-signed or hostname mismatch environments
- Pipeline robustness: invalid pipelines are detected and fall back deterministically instead of silently using placeholder adapters
- Admin UI logging improvements: structured event support and improved Logs viewing UX

### Changed

- Admin UI config management: safer `.env` parsing/writes and clearer apply guidance (“save vs apply” determinism)
- Admin UI health checks: Tier 3/best-effort probe fallbacks with explicit warnings when configured overrides are unreachable
- Admin UI container actions: safer `admin_ui` restart behavior from within the UI
- Compose env semantics: `.env` is authoritative; avoid `${VAR:-default}` fallbacks in compose that prevent UI env changes from taking effect

### Fixed

- Preflight: Debian-family best-effort detection improvements and Debian 12 Docker repo codename fallback (`bookworm`) when `VERSION_CODENAME` is missing
- Admin UI Docker management hardening: restrict compose operations to AAVA services and reduce information exposure in error messages

### Docs

- Upgrade guidance: `v4.6.0 → v5.0.0` checklist in `docs/INSTALLATION.md`
- IPv6 policy: warn/recommend disabling IPv6 for GA stability and document mitigation steps
- Supported platforms: explicit Tier 3 best-effort guidance for openSUSE and Podman

## [4.5.3] - 2025-12-22

### Added

- ExternalMedia RTP hardening: remote endpoint pinning (`external_media.lock_remote_endpoint`) and allowlist support (`external_media.allowed_remote_hosts`)
- Tests for RTP routing/security and Prometheus label cardinality
- Admin UI backend: model switching mappings for `faster_whisper` STT and `melotts` TTS

### Changed

- Default provider now `local_hybrid` (pipeline-first GA default)
- Readiness probe is pipeline-aware when `default_provider` references a pipeline (e.g., `local_hybrid`)
- Prometheus metrics are low-cardinality only (removed per-call labels like `call_id`; per-call detail lives in Call History)

### Fixed

- ExternalMedia RTP SSRC routing: prevent cross-call audio mixing by using authoritative `call_id` in engine callback
- Admin UI HealthWidget rebuild payload: stop mis-parsing model/voice identifiers
- Local provider readiness badge: report “configured” vs “connected” semantics correctly

### Removed

- Legacy bundled Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack and `monitoring/` assets from the main repo path (Call History-first debugging; bring-your-own monitoring)

### Improved (Onboarding & DX)

- Preflight is now **required** (not recommended) in all documentation
- Admin UI Dockerfile default bind aligned to `0.0.0.0` (matches docker-compose.yml for out-of-box accessibility)
- Prominent ASCII security warning box in `preflight.sh` and `install.sh` post-install output
- Timezone (`TZ`) now configurable via `.env` with `America/Phoenix` default
- README Quick Start includes verification step with health check command
- INSTALLATION.md Path A corrected: preflight required, proper service ordering
- Remote server access (`http://<server-ip>:3003`) now primary instruction alongside localhost

## [4.5.2] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Kokoro API mode**: OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint (`KOKORO_MODE=api`)
- **Kroko Embedded models**: Downloadable from Admin UI Models Page
- **Model hot-swap**: Switch STT/TTS/LLM via WebSocket without container restart
- **MCP tool integration**: External tool framework with Admin UI config
- **Aviation ATIS tool**: Live METAR data from aviationweather.gov

### Changed

- Websockets connection logs moved to DEBUG level
- Local provider auto-reconnects on disconnect (12 min retry)

## [4.5.0] - 2025-12-11

### Fixed - Admin UI Stability 🔧

#### ConfigEditor Critical Fixes (A1-A3, A9)

- **Missing State Hooks**: Added `loading`, `saving`, `error`, `success`, `restartRequired` useState declarations
- **Duplicate Import**: Removed duplicate `AudioSocketConfig` import
- **Provider Type Persistence**: New providers now correctly save their `type` field
- **Provider Name Validation**: Empty provider names are now rejected with error message
- **Unused Code Cleanup**: Removed 15+ unused icon imports, reducing bundle size

#### Save Flow Improvements (A6)

- **Restart Required Banner**: UI now displays amber banner when config changes require engine restart
- **Toast Notifications**: Replaced browser `alert()` with inline dismissible notifications
- **Loading Spinner**: Added visual feedback during config fetch

#### Docker Operations (A4-A5)

- **Dynamic Path Resolution**: Uses `shutil.which()` to find docker-compose instead of hardcoded paths
- **Cleaner Restarts**: Uses `container.restart()` via Docker SDK instead of destructive stop/rm/up flow
- **Fallback Support**: Gracefully falls back to docker-compose if Docker SDK fails

#### Config File Safety (A8, A11, A12)

- **Atomic Writes**: Config and .env files written via temp file + atomic rename (prevents corruption on crash)
- **Backup Rotation**: Only keeps last 5 backups per file (prevents disk exhaustion)
- **Env Validation**: Rejects empty keys, newlines in values, and `=` in keys before writing .env

### Added - Stability Improvements 🛡️

#### Enhanced Timer Logging (L2)

- **Structured Timer Logs**: All timer operations now log with `[TIMER]` prefix for easy filtering
- **Timer Lifecycle Tracking**: Logs show scheduled, executed, and cancelled timer events
- **Pending Timer Count**: `get_pending_timer_count()` method exposes timer queue depth

#### Health Check Improvements (L4)

- **Uptime Tracking**: `/health` endpoint now returns `uptime_seconds`
- **Pending Timers**: Health response includes `pending_timers` count
- **Active Sessions**: Added `active_sessions` field (alias for `active_calls`)
- **Real Conversation Metrics**: `conversation` object now pulls live data from ConversationCoordinator

#### Graceful Shutdown Handler (M4)

- **SIGTERM Handling**: `docker stop` now waits up to 30 seconds for active calls to complete
- **Shutdown Logging**: `[SHUTDOWN]` prefixed logs track graceful shutdown progress
- **Configurable Timeout**: `engine.stop(graceful_timeout=30)` parameter for custom drain time

### Changed

#### Code Cleanup (H1)

- **Removed Legacy Code**: Deleted commented `active_calls` legacy code block from engine.py
- **SessionStore is Single Source**: All session state now uses SessionStore exclusively

## [4.4.3] - 2025-12-10

#### Dashboard
- **STT/TTS Dropdowns**: Show individual model names in optgroups instead of counts (e.g., "vosk-model-en" instead of "Vosk (2)")
- **Metrics Display**: Added null guards to prevent "NaN%" when backend is unavailable

#### Providers Page
- **Local Provider Form**: Fixed form visibility for full agent mode local providers
- **Currently Loaded Section**: Added live display of STT/LLM/TTS model status
- **Test Connection - Local**: Now tests actual local_ai_server WebSocket connection and verifies all 3 models are loaded

  - Eliminated reliance on timeout-only fallback mechanism
  - Ensures consistent call termination regardless of OpenAI audio generation
- **Self-Interruption Prevention**: Resolved agent overhearing itself and interrupting mid-response
  - Increased `post_tts_end_protection_ms` from 100ms to 800ms (8x longer guard window)
  - Tuned `turn_detection.threshold` from 0.5 to 0.6 (less sensitive to agent's own voice)
  - Increased `turn_detection.silence_duration_ms` from 600ms to 1000ms (more patient turn-taking)
  - Result: Clean, natural conversation flow without choppy interruptions
- **Greeting Timing**: Attempted optimization of `session.updated` ACK timeout (reverted due to audio issues)

#### Local Hybrid Pipeline

  - Uses ARI `continue()` pattern consistent with queue/ring group transfers
  - `transfer_active` flag prevents premature caller hangup
  - Configurable voicemail box extension number
- **Interactive Prompt Strategy**: Tool asks "Are you ready to leave a message now?" to work around FreePBX VoiceMail app behavior
  - VoiceMail app requires bidirectional RTP and voice activity before playing greeting
  - Without caller interaction, 5-8 second delay occurs before greeting plays
  - Caller response establishes RTP path and triggers greeting immediately
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed behavioral analysis and timeline evidence in module docstring
- **Production Verified**: Tested and deployed on live production server

### Changed

## [4.1.0] - 2025-11-10

### 🎉 Tool Calling & Agent CLI Release

Version 4.1 introduces **unified tool calling architecture** enabling AI agents to perform actions like call transfers and email management, plus production-ready **Agent CLI tools** for operations.

### Added

#### Tool Calling System
- **Unified Tool Architecture**: Write tools once, use with any provider
  - Base classes: `Tool`, `ToolDefinition`, `ToolRegistry` (`src/tools/base.py`, 231 lines)
  - Execution context with session and ARI access (`src/tools/context.py`, 108 lines)
  - Singleton registry for tool management (`src/tools/registry.py`, 198 lines)
  - Provider adapters for Deepgram (202 lines) and OpenAI Realtime (215 lines)

#### Telephony Tools
- **Transfer Call Tool**: Warm and blind transfers with direct SIP origination
  - `src/tools/telephony/transfer.py` (504 lines)
  - Department name resolution (e.g., "support" → extension 6000)
  - Warm transfer: AI stays on line until agent answers
  - Blind transfer: Immediate redirect
  - Production validated: <150ms execution time
  - Call IDs: `1762731796.4233` (Deepgram), `1762734947.4251` (OpenAI)
- **Cancel Transfer Tool**: Cancel in-progress transfer before agent answers
  - `src/tools/telephony/cancel_transfer.py`
  - Allows caller to change mind during ring
- **Hangup Call Tool**: Graceful call termination with farewell message
  - `src/tools/telephony/hangup.py`
  - Customizable farewell message
  - Works with all providers

#### Email Tools
- **Request Transcript Tool**: Caller-initiated transcript delivery
  - `src/tools/business/request_transcript.py` (475 lines)
  - Email parsing from speech ("john dot smith at gmail dot com")
  - Domain validation via DNS MX record lookup
  - Confirmation flow (AI reads back email for verification)
  - Deduplication (prevents sending same email multiple times)
  - Admin receives BCC on all transcript requests
  - Resend API integration
- **Send Email Summary Tool**: Auto-send call summaries to admin
  - `src/tools/business/email_summary.py` (347 lines)
  - Triggered automatically after every call
  - Full conversation transcript with timestamps
  - Call metadata (duration, caller ID, date/time)
  - Professional HTML formatting
  - Admin email configuration in YAML

#### Agent CLI Tools
- **Binary Distribution System**:
  - Makefile build system for 5 platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD for automated releases (`.github/workflows/release-cli.yml`)
  - One-line installer: `curl -sSL ... | bash` (`scripts/install-cli.sh`, 223 lines)
  - SHA256 checksums for security verification
  - Automated binary uploads to GitHub releases
- **CLI Commands**:
  - `agent doctor`: System health checks and validation
  - `agent troubleshoot`: Call analysis and debugging
  - `agent demo`: Feature demonstrations
  - `agent init`: Interactive setup wizard
  - `agent version`: Build and version information
- **Platform Support**:
  - Linux AMD64/ARM64 (servers, Raspberry Pi, AWS Graviton)
  - macOS AMD64/ARM64 (Intel Macs and Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3)
  - Windows AMD64
  - Pre-built binaries with automatic platform detection

#### Conversation Tracking
- **Real-time Tracking**: Both Deepgram and OpenAI Realtime track conversation turns
  - `conversation_history` field in `CallSession` model
  - Tracks role (user/assistant), content, and timestamps
  - Enables email tools to include full transcripts
  - Pattern identical across providers (46-51 lines each)

### Improved

#### Warm Transfer Implementation
- **Direct SIP Endpoint Origination**: Eliminates Local channel complexity
  - Previous: Used `Local/{ext}@{context}/n` → caused unidirectional audio
  - Current: Direct SIP origination (e.g., `SIP/6000`)
  - Result: Perfect bidirectional audio confirmed
  - No Local channels created (verified in production)
- **4-Step Cleanup Sequence**:
  1. Remove AI channel from bridge (<50ms)
  2. Stop provider session gracefully (<30ms)
  3. Add agent SIP channel to bridge (<20ms)
  4. Update session metadata (<10ms)
  - Total: <150ms for complete transfer execution
- **Production Validation**:
  - Call duration: 38+ seconds after transfer (stable)
  - Bridge type: simple_bridge (optimal, 2 channels only)
  - Audio path: Direct (1 hop, minimal latency)
  - Files: `src/tools/telephony/transfer.py`, `src/engine.py` (transfer handler)

#### OpenAI Realtime Stability
- **VAD Re-enable Timing Fix**: Correct event for greeting protection
  - Issue: Used `response.audio.done` (fires per segment) → VAD enabled too early
  - Fix: Changed to `response.done` (fires when complete response generated)
  - Impact: Greeting now plays completely before accepting interruptions
  - Lines: `src/providers/openai_realtime.py` (1206-1219)
- **API Modality Constraints**: Documented OpenAI requirements
  - Supported: `["text"]` or `["audio", "text"]`
  - Not supported: `["audio"]` alone (API rejects)
  - Known limitation: May occasionally generate text-only responses
  - Mitigation: System handles gracefully with keepalive messages
- **Race Condition Handling**: Handles variable event arrival order
  - Sometimes: `response.done` arrives before audio deltas
  - Other times: Audio deltas arrive first
  - Solution: Check `had_audio_burst` flag, re-enable VAD regardless

### Fixed

- **AAVA-57**: Direct SIP endpoint origination for warm transfers
  - Root cause: Local channels caused audio direction mismatch
  - Solution: Direct `SIP/extension` origination
  - Evidence: Call logs show no Local channels, perfect audio
- **AAVA-58**: Local channel audio direction issue (RCA documented)
  - Symptom: Caller heard agent, but agent couldn't hear caller
  - Root cause: Audio path `caller → Local;2 → Local;1 → nowhere`
  - Solution: Eliminated Local channels entirely
- **AAVA-59**: AI provider cleanup during transfer
  - Issue: AI stayed in bridge after agent answered
  - Solution: Remove external media channel before adding agent
  - Result: Clean 2-channel bridge (caller + agent only)
- **AAVA-62**: OpenAI Realtime audio generation analysis and constraints
  - Issue #1: Greeting interrupted (VAD enabled too early)
  - Issue #2: 45-second silence (OpenAI generated text-only)
  - Solution: Correct VAD timing + documented API limitation
  - Commits: `85c4235`, `80efdcd`, `6dbd51e`
- **AAVA-52**: Email tools race conditions and missing await
  - Bug #1: `context.get_session()` called without `await`
  - Bug #2: Auto-summary triggered async, session removed first
  - Bug #3: Undefined `caller_id` variable
  - Bug #4: No email confirmation flow
  - Bug #5: Duplicate emails when caller corrected address
  - Commits: `1deed05`, `700993f`, `5579ddd`, `a2d9409`, `835ac05`

### Documentation

- **New Guides**:
  - `docs/TOOL_CALLING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive tool calling documentation
    - Overview and supported providers
    - All 5 tools with example conversations
    - Configuration details with option explanations
    - Dialplan setup requirements

- **Updated**:
  - README with v4.1 features and tool examples
  - Architecture.md with tool calling section
  - Configuration comments in `config/ai-agent.yaml`
  - SECURITY.md with v4.1 support

### Known Limitations

- **OpenAI Realtime**: May occasionally generate text-only responses
  - Root cause: API limitation with `["audio", "text"]` modalities
  - Frequency: Varies (test call had 2/4 responses without audio)
  - Impact: Caller experiences brief silence
  - Mitigation: System handles gracefully with keepalive messages
  - Not fixable: Cannot force OpenAI to always generate audio
- **Tool Calling**: Currently Deepgram and OpenAI Realtime only
  - Custom Pipeline support planned for v4.3 (AAVA-56)
  - Other providers: Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini (v4.3+)

### Architecture Validation

**Provider-Agnostic Design Confirmed**:
- Same tool code (504 lines for transfer) works with both providers
- Only adapters differ (202 lines Deepgram, 215 lines OpenAI)
- Zero code duplication in tool logic
- Adding new providers requires <250 lines of adapter code

**Line Counts**:
- Tool calling framework: 537 lines (base + context + registry)
- Transfer call tool: 504 lines (shared by all providers)
- Email summary tool: 347 lines (shared)
- Request transcript tool: 475 lines (shared)
- Deepgram adapter: 202 lines
- OpenAI adapter: 215 lines
- **Total duplication**: 0 lines ✅

### Performance Metrics

**Transfer Tool**:
- Transfer execution: <150ms
- AI cleanup time: <100ms
- Bridge technology: simple_bridge (optimal)
- Audio path: Direct (1 hop)
- Call stability: 38+ seconds validated

**Email Tools**:
- Email validation: <100ms (DNS MX lookup)
- Email delivery: ~200ms (Resend API)
- Conversation tracking: Real-time (no performance impact)
